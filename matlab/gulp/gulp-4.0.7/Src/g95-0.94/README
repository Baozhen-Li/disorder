The goal of the g95 project is to create a free, open source Fortran 95
compiler.  The code has been donated to the Free Software
Foundation for inclusion in GCC, the GNU Compiler Collection.

WARNING:

G95 is in a not-quite-done state.  Almost all of the fortran 95
standard has been implemented, but there are still many bugs lurking
in the background.  Use with caution.
