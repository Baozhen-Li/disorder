%--------------------------------------------------------------------------

Organic materials have been investigated as substitutes of silicon and 
other inorganic
semiconductors in next-generation photovoltaic devices.1,2 The
Impressive power conversion efficiency (PCE) results have 
been obtained with ‘‘bulk heterojunctions’’ (BHJ) photoactive 
layers where an electron acceptor A (n-type organic) and an
electron donor D (p-type semiconductor) are blended together to form an  
interpenetrated network of two phases.5 
Recently, significant improvment in PCE for BHJs has been made 
using fullerene-derived 
[6,6]-phenyl-C61-butyric acid
methyl ester (PCBM) as the electron acceptor and  
semi-crystalline thiophene-based polymers such as 
poly(3-hexylthiophene) (P3HT) with carbazole and benxothiazole 
incorporated as the electron donor material. 
Unlike pure fullerene (C$_{60}$),(cite) PCBM is soluble in
common solvents such as toluene, monochlorobenzene
(MCB),
%\href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chlorobenzene}{monochlorobenzene}
ortho-dichlorobenzene (oDCB) 
%\href{http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1,2-Dichlorobenzene}{ortho-dichlorobenzene (oDCB)}
and dichloromethane
(DCM). 
%\href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dichloromethane}{dichloromethane (DCM)}

The control of blend morphology through deposition and
post-deposition treatments (high-boiling additives, thermal and
solvent annealing, etc.) has also proven to be extremely impor-
tant.7 By contrast, no substantial performance improvements
have been observed so far by replacing PCBM with similar
compounds or other n-type materials.



First of all, the
overall PCE of the device depends on different physical
processes, such as light absorption, exciton dissociation into free
positive and negative charges (holes and electrons, respectively),
charge transport and collection at the two electrodes. Optimizing
one at the expense of the other would not be very productive.
Secondly, it is desirable that the materials have some solubility in
common organic solvents, so as to be deposited by simple and
cheap methods such as spin-coating (laboratory scale) or
printing technologies (industrial scale). Finally, once a blend
with good PCE and processability has been identified, it should
retain its performance for several years. This requires long-term
stability against both chemical degradation processes and phys-
ical changes in the active layer morphology.

The first prototypes of organic BHJ cells were made of poly(p-
phenylene vinylene) derivatives (PPVs) as donors and fullerenes
as acceptors, in particular the [6,6]-phenyl-C61-butyric acid
methyl ester (PCBM). Unlike C60, this compound is soluble in
common solvents such as toluene (TOL), monochlorobenzene
(MCB), ortho-dichlorobenzene (oDCB) and dichloromethane
(DCM). Significant performance improvements have been
obtained by changing the donor material, initially using semi-
crystalline thiophene-based polymers such as poly(3-hexylth-
iophene) (P3HT) and more recently using low band-gap
copolymers, e.g. those incorporating carbazole or benzothiazole
units. The control of blend morphology through deposition and
post-deposition treatments (high-boiling additives, thermal and
solvent annealing, etc.) has also proven to be extremely impor-
tant.7 By contrast, no substantial performance improvements
have been observed so far by replacing PCBM with similar
compounds or other n-type materials. Naturally, significant
research effort has been aimed at the identification of the key
factors which are responsible for the success of PCBM. It is
unnecessary to discuss extensively the different attempts, many
of which have been reviewed elsewhere.5–7 In order to set the
stage for our work, we will simply mention some experimental
studies of the PCBM structure and phase behaviour (either as
a pure material or in blends with P3HT, which still represents the
most important system for fundamental studies) and comment
on recent molecular modelling work.



Our work is based on the crystalline form of PCBM based on 
the experimental work of Rispens...

A complementary line of research has concerned the deter-
mination of crystal structures adopted by PCBM, either in the
pure form or in the PCBM-rich phase of the blends. Using
extremely slow solvent evaporation conditions and maintaining
a solvent saturated atmosphere, Rispens et al.15 succeeded in

Other
authors have developed coarse-grained models of PCBM, to be
used jointly with coarse-grained models of P3HT in simulations
of BHJ blend morphologies.26 At the other extreme, 



In the first modelling study of PCBM,23 a series of plane-wave
ab initio density functional calculations were carried out on
highly idealized structures, containing a single independent
molecule and derived from the classical packings of spherical
objects (i.e., body-centered cubic, face-centered cubic, etc.). The
paper23 supports the idea that close contacts of the fullerene
moiety are the essential supermolecular features determining the
band gap of the crystalline system. Unfortunately, with the
exception of the ‘‘simple cubic’’ model which shows a plausible
density of 1.56 Mg mÀ3, the other PCBM models have densities
that are 10–20% lower than this value, casting doubts on the
validity of some of the more detailed conclusions of this paper.

it is possible
to model the structure and electronic properties of individual
fullerene-based molecules (equilibrium geometries, thermo-
chemistry, ionization and excitation energies, vibrational
spectra, etc.) using ab initio density functional calculations.27


On the other hand, Cheung and Trosi24 started their simulations
from the monoclinic structure of Rispens et al.15 (P1D1), from
which the oDCB molecules were removed, and then carried out
a series of molecular dynamics (MD) simulations with an
empirical force field. The authors indicate that the structure
remains similar to the experimental crystal structure determined
at 90 K, which is characterized by alternating fullerene-rich and
alkyl-rich layers. This structural stability persists even at 500 K.
The electron transport properties of PCBM are then discussed
using the snapshots extracted from the MD trajectories to
calculate a series of quantities such as the energies and the
degrees of localization/delocalization of the electronic states. The
results obtained by these authors are interesting, in that they
challenge many of the common assumptions used in the calcu-
lation of charge hopping rates for organic materials. However,
even in this case it is doubtful that the PCBM model is appro-
priately relaxed. For example, the triclinic P2M1 structure has
a density of 1.56 Mg mÀ3 after solvent removal is taken into
account. This is about 8% higher than the value of the model
used in ref. 24 (1.44 Mg mÀ3 at 300 K), indicating that more
stable packings of PCBM are indeed likely to exist and that they
should be, plausibly, readily accessible.







fullerene-derviative PCBM is a

Phase change random access memory (PRAM) is unique among semiconductor 
devices because heat is intrinsic to the operation of the device, not 
just a by-product. Here, we apply a material that is exotic in the 
context of typical semiconductor devices but has highly desirable 
properties for PRAM. Thin films of C60 are semiconducting and show very 
low thermal conductance. By inserting a C60 layer between the phase 
change material and the metal electrode, we dramatically reduced the heat 
dissipation and, thereby, the operating current. A PRAM device 
incorporating a C60 layer operated stably for more than 105 cycles.
\cite{kim_fullerene_2008}

A novel type of multi-layer vacuum insulation based on carbon 
nano-materials, namely fullerenes, has been demonstrated. The design 
is based on unique thermal insulation properties of fullerenes, arising 
from their electronic structure, as well as proprietary deposition 
technique using thin layers of reflective material as a support. As a 
result of experimental testing, the fabricated samples of fullerene-based 
insulation were shown to possess R-values of 36 to 40 per inch of 
thickness at cryogenic temperatures, which considerably exceeds those 
of commonly available insulation materials (for example, polyurethane 
(R6.7), expanded polystyrene (R3.8), and even vacuum insulated panels 
(R9∼24)). Application of such insulation will result in significant size 
and weight reduction while maintaining cost-effectiveness.
\cite{wexler_thermal_2004}

We have argued that our sample of C60 exhibits a substan-
tial amount of disorder. An indication of this is given by the
phonon mean free path. The mean free path l can be esti-
mated using the simple Debye formula for ␭ which is given
by ␭ϭ(1/3) ␳ c v l ␯ , where ␯ is the phonon velocity and ␳ c v is
the heat capacity per unit volume of the phonons which are
responsible for the heat transport. We associate the vibrating
unit with the C60 molecule ͑c v ϭ25 J molϪ1 KϪ1, ␳ϭ2400
mol mϪ3͒ and approximate ␯ with the sound velocity
͑Ϸ2ϫ103 m sϪ1͒, which yields lϭ50 Å at 200 K ͑about three
lattice constants͒. Although the absolute value for l obtained
in this way needs to be treated with caution, the true l is
almost certainly rather small. It probably follows that the
amount of defects must be substantial but a quantification is
not possible without specific knowledge of their ability to
scatter phonons.
\cite{andersson_thermal_1995}

Using a microcalorimeter, we have measured the specific heat of C60 
and K3 C60 thin films from 6–400 K.
The results can be understood by analyzing the phonon modes; the 
electronic specific heat of K3C60 is a small
fraction of the total. While C60 displays a clear separation of 
energy levels between interball and intraball
modes, the added ͑alkali͒ optical modes in K3C60 blur this separation 
because they appear in the gap. Addi-
tionally, the acoustic modes of K3 C60 soften compared to pure C60.

and intercorrelated.
\cite{aksenova_analysis_1999}

Using a novel microcalorimeter, we have performed the first specific heat 
measurements of C84 ,
Sc2 @C84 , C82 , and La@C82 ͑10–300 K͒. We analyze these results using a 
framework based on the
phonon modes in these materials. C84 compares qualitatively to C60 with a 
clear separation between
inter- and intraball modes, although the interball modes are significantly 
softer in C84 . For Sc2 @C84
the added optical modes due to the metal atoms are high-energy Einstein 
modes comparable to the
on-ball modes. Thus, the specific heat of Sc2 @C84 is very similar to that 
of C84 ; and likewise, the
specific heat of La@C82 resembles that of C82 . Remarkably, however, C82 
contrasts sharply with
the other empty fullerenes in that it shows no separation of energy levels 
between inter- and intraball
modes. We speculate about possible causes of this anomalous behavior.
In conclusion, we have shown from specific heat experi-
ments that C84 behaves qualitatively like C60 in terms of a
separation of energy levels between interball and intraball
modes. Thus, C84 is a molecular solid like C60 with weak
bonds between the balls and strong bonds on the balls. How-
ever, C84 shows significantly softer interball modes than C60 ,
saturating by 10 K, implying that the highest energy interball
modes are below 1 eV. Adding Sc inside the balls to make
Sc2 @C84 makes almost no difference to C p because the Sc
optical modes are high-energy modes that add into the intra-
ball modes instead of appearing in the gap as they do for
K3 C60 . 16 C82 , however, differs even more severely from the
other pure fullerenes studied. It shows no two-tiered behav-
ior in C p , and hence no separation of energy levels. La@C82
actually shows somewhat more separation of energy levels
than pure C82 due, we suggest, to a stiffening of low-energy
on-ball modes from the La–C bond, but it too has no true
separation of energy levels.
