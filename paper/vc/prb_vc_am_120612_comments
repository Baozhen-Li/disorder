Jason,

Here are my comments on the first 14 or so pages of the VC manuscript. After
that, as you had said, it gets a bit jumbled.

%--------------------------------------------------------------------------
1. Be careful not to get ahead of yourself, the manuscript should read as a
linear narrative. For example, in Section IIE1, you talk a lot about section
IIE2. I suggest either flipping the two sections, or just providing the
comparisons when you get to IIE2.

%--------------------------------------------------------------------------
2. PRB doesn't have a page restriction, so there is no need to put equations
in line with the text. Give every equations its own number.

done?

%--------------------------------------------------------------------------
3. I think that some minor reorganization/renaming of section will help.
Here is my suggestion, with more comments below:

I Introduction
Combine existing introduction with parts of IIA, which is essentially your
literature review.

IIA Thermal Conductivity Models

IIB Simulation Details (what is now in IIC)

IIC Density of States

IID Dispersion (you call it group velocity, but it is really a discussion of
how to get the dispersion curves, which are required to get the group
velocities)

IIE Lifetimes

IIF Diffusivities

done

%--------------------------------------------------------------------------
4. Be sure to refer to the appendices in the main text.

%--------------------------------------------------------------------------
5. For the introduction: explain why alloys are important technologically,
role of thermal transport. You want to investigate what happens to the
fundamental mechanisms of thermal transport in alloys when you change the
composition.

%--------------------------------------------------------------------------
6. For the introduction: provide a concise, general definition (if possible)
of the virtual crystal approximation. You may need to acknowledge that there
are different flavors. Is there a version virtual crystal for amorphous
materials?

%--------------------------------------------------------------------------
7. For the introduction: one of your objectives is to test the limits of the
virtual crystal approximation.

%--------------------------------------------------------------------------
8. In Thermal Conductivity Models section, motivate what it is we want to do
(predict phonon properties and thermal conductivity), how we will do it
(BTE), what input is required. As of now, you just jump into it. One
important question is what conditions are necessary for us to use Eq. (1) to
model alloys.

%--------------------------------------------------------------------------
9. Too much detail in Fig. 1 caption. Just make your point! Refer to this
figure somewhere in the text.

%--------------------------------------------------------------------------
10. Can you confirm that your alloy thermal conductivities are isotropic?

they are within the errors introduced by the finite system.

%--------------------------------------------------------------------------
11. Transition on p5 from crystal to AF is weak. Maybe provide the kAF
equation here? Comment that AF was developed for amorphous. Has anyone else
tried to apply it to alloys before?

%--------------------------------------------------------------------------
12. The point of the calculations of DOS, dispersion, and lifetimes is to
check all these quantities before predicting thermal conductivity. I think
that you should be able to more clearly lay out the plan for Section II at
the start, making it clear for the reader. You do this on p4, but I think
that it could be clearer.

%--------------------------------------------------------------------------
13. Section IID1 contains details about the motivation and the calculation.
I would move the motivation (e.g., role/importance/challenges of MFP) into
the new section IIA.

needs work

%--------------------------------------------------------------------------
14. For alloys sound speeds, have you checked the CRC handbook, or some
other large reference book?

needs work

%--------------------------------------------------------------------------
15. Provide enough equations so that the reader knows how E in Eq. (6) is
calculated.

needs work

%--------------------------------------------------------------------------
16. p12: more discussion of concentration trend, comparison between VC and
Gamma. Discuss physical origin of Ioffe-Regel. Is there a physical origin of
the minimum lifetime? Can it be predicted?>

needs work

%--------------------------------------------------------------------------
17. Discussion of g(b) equation is not clear.

needs work

%--------------------------------------------------------------------------
18. Better motivate why you also look at SW starting with the lifetimes.
Explain what is plotted in Figs. 5 and 6.
