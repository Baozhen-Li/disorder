%--------------------------------------------------------------------------
The virtual crystal approximation for mass disorder is 
evaluated by examining two model alloy systems: Lennard-Jones argon 
and Stillinger-Weber silicon. In both cases the perfect crystal is 
alloyed with a heavier mass species up to equal concentration and 
phonon frequencies, lifetimes and group velocities and thermal 
conductivity are predicted. These 
two alloy systems have different ranges of phonon frequencies, 
lifetimes.
For Stillinger-Weber silicon, the 
virtual crystal approximation predicts phonon properties and thermal 
conductivity in reasonably good agreement with molecular 
dynamics-based methods. For Lennard-Jones argon, the virtual crystal 
approximation underpredicts 
the high-frequency phonon lifetimes, leading to an underpredicting of 
its thermal conductivity. Resolution of this underprediction is achieved 
by considering methods that treat the disorder explicitly.

\section{\label{S:Introduction}Introduction}
%--------------------------------------------------------------------------

Disordered materials (i.e., alloys and amorphous solids) are used in 
applications ranging from semiconducting devices to thermally insulating  
barriers due to their low thermal conductivities.(cite) 
An alloy is a lattice composed of multiple species which are spatially 
random (e.g. isotopic germanium).\cite{tamura_isotope_1983} 
Alloying (creating a disordered lattice) remains an effective method 
to reduce the thermal conductivity 
while maintaining good electrical transport properties.(cite) 
For example, reducing 
the thermal conductivity of thermolectric materials can improve the 
efficiency of thermoelectric devices.
\cite{koh_lattice_2009,qiu_molecular_2012,tian_phonon_2012} 

Theoretical predictions for the thermal conductivity of disordered 
lattices dates back to 
the work of Abeles, who showed that mass and strain 
disorder dominate the thermal resistivity of Si-Ge and 
(Ga,In)-As alloys, respectively.\cite{abeles_lattice_1963} The Abeles 
theory assumed that the vibrations in the alloys were phonons, 
delocalized propagating modes, whose properties were computed 
assuming the disorder was a perturbation.
Except for low-frequency (long-wavelength) modes, it is not clear 
which vibrational modes are phonon-like in alloys with arbitrary 
disorder. 

In the case of dielectrics, almost all of the heat is conducted by
the vibrational modes of the system. 
Understanding how these vibrations contribute to thermal transport 
is crucial for predicting the 
thermal conductivity of ordered and disordered lattices. 
Accurately predicting the thermal conductivity of a dielectric or 
semiconducting material requires the properties from the full spectrum 
of vibrational modes.
\cite{ziman_electrons_2001,feldman_thermal_1993,allen_diffusons_1999} 
Accurate predictions of these properties for bulk systems 
can be made with anharmonic lattice dynamics (ALD) theory 
using \emph{ab initio} 
calculations.\cite{ward_intrinsic_2010,lindsay_thermal_2012,
garg_role_2011,
shiga_microscopic_2012,tian_phonon_2012,
shiomi_thermal_2011,esfarjani_heat_2011}
However, computational costs limit the size of computational cells 
in \emph{ab initio} calculations to be less than 100 atoms, 
making it difficult to explicitly incorporate the effects of disorder.
\cite{koker_thermal_2009,bao_first-principles_2012,
lindsay_thermal_2012,tian_phonon_2012,garg_role_2011}

Recently, work using \emph{ab initio} calculations, anharmonic 
lattice dynamics (ALD), and the virtual crystal (VC) 
approximation predicted phonon mode frequencies, lifetimes and 
group velocities of defected materials with realtively
large (order 100 W/m-K\cite{garg_role_2011,lindsay_thermal_2012}) 
and 
small (order 1 W/m-K\cite{tian_phonon_2012}) 
thermal conductivities that compare well with experimental 
measurements. 
Under the VC approximation, the disordered 
solid is replaced with a perfect “virtual crystal” with properties 
equivalent to an averaging over the disorder (e.g., mass or bond 
strength).\cite{abeles_lattice_1963}
The use of ALD with the VC approximation 
(referred to herein as VC-ALD) can base  
all calculations on a small unit cell with averaged properties and 
treat the effects of intrinsic and disorder scattering as perturbations.
\cite{abeles_lattice_1963,tamura_isotope_1983,
tian_phonon_2012,lindsay_thermal_2012} 
No comprehensive study has been performed 
to assess the applicability of this perturbative approach for a range 
of disorder (varying alloy concentrations, Section 
\ref{S:Virtual Crystal}) 
using multiple predictive methods and test systems to test 
the self-consistentcy of the VC approximation. 

The goal of this work is to investigate the use of the VC 
approximation for predicting vibrational mode properties and 
thermal conductivity of alloys by a detailed comparison 
of three predictive methods: (i) Molecular Dynamics (MD)-based 
normal mode 
decomposition (NMD, Section \ref{S:From VC Gamma}), 
(ii) MD-based green-kubo (GK, Section \ref{S:Thermal Conductivity} ), 
and (iii) VC-ALD (Section \ref{S:From VC-ALD}). 
Using computationally-cheap empirical potentials for argon
\cite{ashcroft_solid_1976} 
and silicon\cite{stillinger_computer_1985},  
we study the effects of disorder explicitly.
For both LJ argon and SW silicon, the perfect lattice is 
disordered with a heavier mass species up to equal 
concentration ($c=0.5$), spanning 
a range of perturbative to large disorder. By spanning this range, 
the limits of the perturbative models are examined.

We predict 
the phonon mode properties of the VC:  
frequencies (Section \ref{S:Vibrational}), 
group velocities (Section \ref{S:Dispersion} ),  
and lifetimes (Section \ref{S:Phonon Lifetimes}), 
and use them to predict thermal
conductivity (Section \ref{S:Thermal Conductivity}). 
The breakdown of the perturbative VC-ALD method is examined 
(Section \ref{S:From VC-ALD}), 
and a simple guideline is suggested by  
the AF theory (Section \ref{S:Diffusivities}), which predicts 
the thermal transport properties of the vibrations of the 
explcitly disordered lattices.

\subsection{\label{S:Thermal Theory}
Thermal Conductivity Predictions}
%--------------------------------------------------------------------------

To predict the thermal conducitivty of disordered lattices, 
one begins with the theory for a perfect lattice. For a perfect lattice, 
all vibrational modes are phonon modes, which by 
defintion are delocalized, propagating plane waves.
\cite{ziman_electrons_2001} Using the single-mode relaxation
time approximation \cite{ziman_electrons_2001} to solve 
the Boltzmann transport equation \cite{peierls_quantum_2001} gives an 
expression for thermal conductivity,
\begin{equation}\label{EQ:k_vib}
\begin{split}
k_{ph,\mathbf{n}}=&\sum_{\pmb{\kappa}} \sum_\nu c_{ph}\kv 
v^{2}_{g,\mathbf{n}}\kv \tau\kv.
\end{split}
\end{equation}
Here, $\pmb{\kappa}$ is the wavevector and 
$\nu$ labels the phonon polarization.  
The phonon mode has frequency $\omega\kv$, 
$c_{ph}\kv$ is the phonon volumetric specific heat, 
${v}_{g,\mathbf{n}}\kv$ is
the component of the group velocity vector in direction $\mathbf{n}$, 
and $\tau\kv$ is the phonon lifetime. 

The SMRT approximation has been shown to be accurate for SiGe alloys  
and lower thermal conductivity materials, while larger conductivity 
materials such as GaN and Diamond require a full 
iterative solution to the BTE for more accurate predictions.
\cite{garg_role_2011,lindsay_thermal_2012,ward_intrinsic_2010} 
For the cubic lattices considered in this 
work, the lattices and the components of their 
thermal conductivity are cubically symmetric, so that we refer to 
$k_{ph}$ as a scalar thermal conductivity. 
This is also true for the disordered lattices 
in the infinte size limit. 
Since MD simiulations are classical 
and obey Maxwell-Boltzmann 
statistics,\cite{mcquarrie_statistical_2000} the volumetric 
specific heat is $k_{B}/V$ per mode in the harmonic limit, where $V$ 
is the system volume. This approximation has been shown to be valid 
for LJ argon and SW silicon and is used 
in this work so that direct comparisons can be made between methods.
\cite{larkin_comparison_2012}

For disordered systems, the vibrational modes of the system are no 
longer pure plane-waves (phonon modes), except in the low-frequency 
(long-wavelength) limit. The Allen-Feldman (AF) theory computes 
the contribution of diffusive, non-propagating modes to vibrational 
conductivity.\cite{allen_thermal_1993} 
In the AF theory, the thermal conductivity is written as
\begin{equation}\label{EQ:M:k_AF}
k_{AF} = \sum_{modes} \frac{k_{B}}{V} D_{AF}(\omega),
\end{equation}
where $D_{AF}$ is the mode-specific thermal diffusivity of  
disordered vibrational modes defined at the wavevector [000].   

In this high-scatter (HS) limit, 
the AF thermal conductivity prediction is
\begin{equation}\label{EQ:M:k_AF,HS}
k_{AF,HS} = \frac{k_{B}}{V_b}b v_s a,
\end{equation}
where $V_b$ is the volume of the unit cell, $v_s$ is the 
branch-averaged sound speed, and $a$ is the lattice constant.
\cite{cahill_lattice_1988} The relative contribution of both
phonons and diffusons to the total vibrational 
conductivity has been estimated 
to be approximately equal for a-Si,\cite{he_heat_2011} while earlier 
studies find that $k_{ph}$ is substatiantially less.
\cite{feldman_numerical_1999} 
While studies have been performed on alloying the amorphous phase, the 
AF theory has not been applied to disordered lattices.
\cite{feldman_thermal_1993} 
In the current study of disordered lattices, 
the AF theory predictions provide a lower limit for the contribution 
of a given vibrational mode within the computational 
framework of the VC approximation. This is essential given 
the computational cost of the AF theory (Section ).

\subsection{\label{S:Virtual Crystal}Virtual Crystal Approximation}
%--------------------------------------------------------------------------

Under the Vitrual Crystal (VC) approximation, the disordered 
solid is replaced with a perfect “virtual crystal” with properties 
equivalent to an averaging over the disorder (e.g., mass or bond 
strength).\cite{abeles_lattice_1963}
Abeles first introduced the idea of using a VC to 
replace a disordered one, computing the
thermal conductivity of SiGe, (Ga,In)As and In(As,P) alloys using  
Klemens-Callaway theory
\cite{klemens_scattering_1955,klemens_thermal_1957,callaway_model_1959} 
and adjustable phenomological fitting parameters 
to compare favorably with experimental results. 
The Abeles theory is conceptually simple,  
treating both
disorder and anharmonicity as perturbations and expressing the thermal 
conductivity as a closed-form analytical function of the bulk material 
properies.\cite{abeles_lattice_1963} 
While good agreement between predictions and experimental measurements 
was found for SiGe and (Ga,In)As, deviations from the Abeles theory 
were observed for In(As,P) alloys at large concentrations, which was 
attributed to the high mass ratio of 3.7 for InP.
\cite{abeles_lattice_1963}

While the Abeles theory is valid for 
perturbative disorder, its use leads to good agreement with
several experimental and computational results for systems with 
a range of disorder. 
Cahill and co-workers found that conductivty reduction in dilute 
Ge-doped Si epitaxial layers 
can be explained by mass perturbative disorder.
\cite{cahill_thermal_2004,cahill_thermal_2005} 
The effect of bond and mass disorder was investigated computationally 
by Skye and 
Schelling for SiGe \cite{skye_thermal_2008}, 
where it was shown that mass disorder is 
the dominant scattering mechanism. 
While the mass ratio is large ($m_{Ge}/m_{Si} = 2.6$),  
the overall disorder strength is determined by both the mass ratio and 
the alloy concentration (Section \ref{S:From VC-ALD}). 
As little as $6.2\times10^{19} cm^{-3}$ Ge  
is enough to reduce the thermal conductivity of 
Si by almost a factor of 2.\cite{cahill_thermal_2004} 
In the
case of $Ni_{0.55}Pd_{0.45}$, with large mass disorder and 
concentration ($m_{Pd}/m_{Ni} \approx 2$), 
good agreement is seen using the VC approach.
\cite{kamitakahara_vibrations_1974} 
Given these experimental results, it is unclear what limitations exist 
using the VC approach for arbitrary disorder.

Computational results using the VC-ALD method  
for high thermal conductivity 
alloys show good to excellent agreement with experimental results for 
small and large concentrations.
\cite{garg_role_2011,lindsay_thermal_2012} These VC-ALD computations 
use \emph{ab initio} methods to predict 
the mode-specific phonon properties of the VC. Unlike the phenomological 
Abeles theory, the VC-ALD predicts thermal conductivty by summing 
over the whole spectrum of mode-specific phonon properties, where 
intrinsic and defect phonon scattering are treated as perturbations 
(Section ).(cite)  
Lindsay and Broido 
found good agreement with VC-ALD and experiment for 
isotopically defected GaN with relatively small concentrations.
\cite{lindsay_thermal_2012}  
Garg used ab initio calculations with VC-ALD   
to predict the thermal conductivity of SiGe alloys 
for all concentrations, obtaining excellent agreement with experiment.
\cite{garg_role_2011}  
Isotopically defected GaN and SiGe alloys have relatively large 
thermal conductivities.(cite) In 
particular, the conductivity of SiGe alloys is significantly 
larger than that of the high scatter limit, which assumes that all 
vibrations scatter over a distance of the lattice spacing.
\cite{cahill_lattice_1988}  
For both experiment and numerical modeling, VC predictions tend 
to be accurate when the thermal conductivity is significantly above 
the high-scatter limit.

Thus, there is a need to examine the perturbative approach of 
VC-ALD for large (SW silicon) and small (LJ argon) 
thermal conductivity alloys for perturbative and large disorer. 
While the computational studies discussed above were limited to VC-ALD 
because of ab initio calcualtion costs, we use computationally 
cheap empirical potentials to include disorder explicitly.

\subsection{\label{S:Calculation}Calculation and Simulation Details}
%--------------------------------------------------------------------------

Perfect and explicitly disordered lattice supercells are generated 
with atomic positions 
based on LJ argon's FCC ($n=4$) and silicon's diamond-FCC ($n=8$) 
cubic conventional unit cells, where $n$ is the number of atoms 
in the unit cell.   
Supercells are built cubically with size $N_0$, where $N_0$ refers to the 
number of repetitions of the unit cell in all 3 
spatial directions. Supercells up to size $N_0 = 12$ 
(6096 atoms) are used for the LJ argon calculations. For SW silicon, 
$N_0 = 8$ (4096 atoms) is used for 
the MD-based NMD methods, and $N_0 \le 42$ (592704 atoms) 
for MD-based GK and VC-ALD. 
The ALD calculations were performed using an in-house code,
\cite{turney_predicting_2009} with all classical expressions to remain 
consistent with the classical MD-based methods NMD and GK. 

Disorder is created by randomly specifying the masses of the atoms 
on the lattice. 
The composition of the lattices is labeled by $m^i_{1-c}m^j_{c}$,  
where $m^i=1$ and $m^j=3$ in 
LJ units for argon and $m^i=m_{Si}$ and $m^j=2.6m_{Si}$ 
for SW silicon and ``heavy silicon'' (mass of germanium). Concentrations 
of $c=0.0,0.05,0.15$ and $0.5$ are used. 
For SW silicon, the lattice constant $a=5.43 \AA$ is used 
for all calculations, which brings the GK thermal conductivty 
predictions at 300K\cite{goicochea_thermal_2010,he_lattice_2012} 
into better agreement with VC-ALD predictions 
for bulk SW silicon.\cite{sellan_cross-plane_2010} 
For LJ argon, supercells are built using 
the zero-pressure finite-temperature lattice constants, 
which are $a=1.556$ ($T$=10 K) and 
and $a=1.580$ ($T$=40 K) in LJ units.\cite{mcgaughey_phonon_2004} 
For LJ argon, the variation of lattice constant 
with composition is small and ignored.(cite) 
The amorphous LJ phase, discussed in Section , was created by 
liquifying the crystal 
and instantly quenching by removing all kinetic energy.  The resulting 
structure was then energy minimized and annealed in an $NPT$ ensemble at 
zero pressure and $T=10$ K.(cite lammps)) 
The effective zero-pressure lattice constant  
of the amorphous phase at T=10K, based on the atomic 
density, is slightly larger 
($a = 1.585$).\cite{mcgaughey_phonon_2004}  

The MD simulations were performed using the package LAMMPS(cite lammps)  
by equilibrating in a $NVT$ (constant 
number of atoms N, volume V, and temperature T) ensemble before 
calculating atomic positions and velocities in a $NVE$ 
(constant number of 
atoms N, volume V and energy E) ensemble.(cite) For LJ argon, a cutoff 
of $2.5\sigma$ was used, where $\sigma = 3.4 \AA$. 
Statistical averaging is accomplished 
using 10 simulations with different initial velocities. MD simulation 
time steps of 
4.285 and 0.5 fs were used for LJ argon and SW silicon. 
For the GK method, the heat current 
was computed every 10 time steps. It is important to note that the same 
atomic trajectories are used for the NMD and GK methods. 

The key to incorporating the effects of disorder explicitly are the use 
of large disordered supercells. 
However, the methods used 
in this work scale differently with the size of the supercell considered. 
The calculations in this work are trivially parallelizable\cite{} 
except the 
MD simulations\cite{plimpton_fast_1995} and the eigenvalue solution of the 
Dynamical matrix.\cite{gale_general_2003} Efficient MD 
codes scale linearly with the number of atoms in the system, $N_a$.  
However, the computational cost of using large supercells for MD simulation, 
particularly the large number of time steps required 
(on the order of $10^5 - 10^7$ depending on the 
system(cite)), prohibit its use with typical 
\emph{ab initio} methods such as 
plane-wave Density Functional Theory.(cite) The Gamma-NMD and AF theory 
require the solution of a large Dynamical matrix of size 
$(3N_a)^2$, which limits the system sizes considered. 

To predict a bulk thermal conductivity, extrapolation is used by the 
finite-size scaling $ 1 / k(N_0) \propto 1/N_0$. For VC-NMD and 
VC-ALD, the validity of the finite-size scaling 
requires the low frequency modes in the system be dominated by 
intrinsic scattering ($\tau\kv \propto \omega\kv^{-2}$) and  
follow the Debye approximation 
with respect to $v_{g,\mathbf{n}}$ and DOS $D(\omega\kv)$.
\cite{shiomi_thermal_2011,esfarjani_heat_2011} For LJ 
argon alloys, this requirement is satisfied for modest system sizes 
(for $N_0 = 6$ to $12$) so that both VC-NMD and VC-ALD predictions 
can be extrapolated to a bulk value. 
For SW silicon alloys, the thermal conductivity is dominated by low-frequency 
modes, so that large system sizes are needed to satsify the 
extrpaolation requirements and only GK and VC-ALD can be used 
($N_0 \le 42$ in the present study, 
similar to the converged system sizes in\cite{he_lattice_2012}). This 
highlights the efficieny of the VC-ALD method which is 
necessary when computationally expensive 
\emph{ab initio} methods are used (Section ).
\cite{esfarjani_method_2008,garg_role_2011,tian_phonon_2012,

\section{\label{S:Vibrational}
Vibrational Mode Properties in Alloy Systems}
%--------------------------------------------------------------------------

%--------------------------------------------------------------------------
\subsection{\label{S:VC Gamma DOS}VC and Gamma DOS}
%--------------------------------------------------------------------------

In this section, we examine the effect of explicit disorder by computing 
the density of states (DOS, D$(\omega)$) for vibrational modes of  
disordered lattice supercells and their 
equivalent VCs. The frequencies 
are computed using harmonic lattice dynamics calculations with the package 
GULP.\cite{gale_general_2003} For the 
VC, the allowed wavevectors are set by $N_0$, and each wavevector 
represents a finite volume of the crystal lattice's irreducible 
Brillouin zone (BZ).(cite mermin) The symmetry properties of the BZ 
define a set of irreducible wavevectors, which are used to average 
the mode properties of the reducible wavevectors.(cite) 

For the disordered 
supercells,
the only allowed wavevector is the gamma-point (i.e., $\pmb{\kappa}=0$). 
The DOS for the VC and the explicitly disordered supercells 
(referred to herein as Gamma) are shown in Fig. \ref{F:DOS}. 
The VC and Gamma DOS 
agree at low frequencies, where the Debye approximation predicts 
$DOS \propto \omega^2$.(cite) The Debye approximation 
underpredicts the the DOS at moderate frequency, which is due to the 
non-linear dispersion.(cite Mermin)

The increasing lattice 
mass with increasing concentration for the VC reduces  
the frequencies. The increasing lattice 
mass for the Gamma modes also reduces the frequencies.
The effect of expicit disorder is seen at high frequencies by a 
broadening and a shift of the DOS to higher frequencies 
because of the explicit use of light atoms in the supercell. 
Duda et al 
observed similar high-frequency broadening effects in model LJ alloys.
\cite{duda_reducing_2011} 
Similar agreement at low frequencies was found in \emph{ab initio} 
predictions 
for Si$_c$Ge$_{1-c}$,\cite{garg_role_2011} while Bouchard showed similar 
continuous behavior at low frequency for 
a-Si$_c$Ge$_{1-c}$.\cite{bouchard_vibrational_1988} 
Based on the DOS, the vibrational modes of the explicitly disordered 
supercells at low frequencies are phonon-like, while the broadening 
of the DOS at high-frequency indicate that the vibrational modes 
may differ significantly from the high-frequency VC phonon modes.

VC and Gamma show similar low frequency behavior for all $c$. 
For increasing $c$, the frequencies of both VC

The size of these supercells is $N_0 = 12$ 
(see Section \ref{S:Calculation}).

\subsection{\label{S:Dispersion}Dispersion and Group Velocity}
%--------------------------------------------------------------------------

The group velocity vector in a VC is the gradient of the dispersion curves, 
\begin{equation}\label{EQ:Dynamical}
v_{g,\pmb{n}}\kv = \frac{\partial \omega\kv}{\partial \pmb{\kappa}}.
\end{equation}
We calculate the group velocities for the VC  
using finite differences  
and quasi-harmonic lattice dynamics.\cite{mcgaughey_phonon_2006}

Except for the three 
acoustic branches (2 transverse, 1 logitudinal sound speeds), 
there is not an 
accepted method to predict the effective group velocity of a 
vibrational mode in a disordered system, although there have been 
attempts.
\cite{cahill_lattice_1988,duda_reducing_2011,donadio_atomistic_2009,
he_heat_2011,he_thermal_2011} 
In the Cahill-Pohl (CP) model, the group velocity of all disordered 
modes is the sound speed, $v_s$.\cite{cahill_lattice_1988} 
Dispersion for a model disordered 1D system demonstrated   
the reduction of the frequency-dependent group velocities due to the 
zone-folding effect.\cite{duda_reducing_2011} 

Calculating the structure factor of the supercell Gamma   
modes is a method to test for the plane-wave 
character of disordered modes at a particular wavevector and 
polarization. 
\cite{allen_diffusons_1999,feldman_numerical_1999} 
Feldman et al used the structure factor to predict an effective dispersion 
for a model of a-Si, but did not predict group velocities.
\cite{feldman_numerical_1999} 
Volz and Chen used the dynamic structure factor to predict the
dispersion of crystalline SW Si using MD simulation.
\cite{volz_molecular-dynamics_2000}

The structure factor is defined as\cite{allen_diffusons_1999} 
\begin{equation}\label{EQ:SLT}
S^{L,T}\kw = 
\sum_{\nu} E^{L,T}\kv
\delta (\omega-\omega\kgv),
\end{equation}
where $E^{T}$ refers to transverse polarization and is defined as
\begin{equation}\label{EQ:EL}
E^L\kv = 
\left|
\sum_{l,b} 
\hat{\pmb{\kappa}} \cdot e\kgvba 
\EXP{i\pmb{\kappa}\cdot\pmb{r}_0\ab{l=0}{b}} 
\right|^2
\end{equation}
and $E^{L}$ refers to logitudinal polarization and is defined as
\begin{equation}\label{EQ:ET}
E^T\kv = 
\left|
\sum_{l,b} 
\hat{\pmb{\kappa}} \times e\kgvba 
\EXP{i\pmb{\kappa}\cdot\pmb{r}_0\ab{l=0}{b}} 
\right|^2.
\end{equation}
Here, $\pmb{r}_0\ab{l=0}{b}$ refers to the atomic positions of the 
mass disordered atoms in the supercells, which are still spaitally ordered. 
Explicit disorder is accounted for in the mode frequencies $\omega\kgv$ 
and eigenvectors $e\kgvba$, which are calculated with 
$\pmb{\kappa} = \pmb{0}$.

Physically, $S^{L,T}\kw$ represents  
the frequency spectrum required to create a wavepacket with a 
well-defined wavevector and polarization.
\cite{allen_diffusons_1999,feldman_numerical_1999} 
For a perfect lattice, the 
structrue factor peaks are delta functions centered at the phonon mode 
frequencies, indicating they are pure plane-waves. 
The structure factors for LJ argon alloys 
are plotted in Fig. \ref{F:SF} for wavevectors along the [100] and [111] 
directions.
% \footnote[1]{To calculate 
% $S^{L,T}\kw$ for a finite-size system, the 
% delta function in Eq. \eqref{EQ:M:SLT} is broadened using a Lorentzian 
% function with a full-width at half maximum set to 
% 20$\delta_{\omega,avg}$, where $\delta_{\omega,avg}$ 
% is the average frequency spacing.\cite{feldman_numerical_1999}}
With increasing disorder, the structure factor spreads in width,  
particularly at high frequencies because the modes are no longer 
pure plane-waves.  

From Fig. \ref{F:SF}, 
an effective dispersion can be extracted by locating the peaks in the 
structure factors at neighboring VC wavevectors, where the 
effects of polarization, virtual mass, and 
anisotropic dispersion can be observed. 
As the lattice VC mass becomes larger,  
the peaks in the structure factor shift to lower frequencies. 
The peaks in the structure factor are at  
slightly 
higher frequencies than the VC predicted frequencies by 
up to only $\%5$. Similarly, good agreement is found with the disordered 
SW silicon lattice supercells (not shown), 
while the structure factors are 
more complicated because of the optical modes. 
Well-defined peaks 
at all wavevectors are most likely due to the 
lattice structure of the disordered systems studied in this 
work. 
Typically, the structure factor for amorphous materials has well-defined 
peaks only for small wavevector.
\cite{allen_diffusons_1999,feldman_numerical_1999}   

Because of the good agreement between the VC predicted dispersion and 
the peaks in the structure factors from Fig. \ref{F:SF},  
we use the group velocities predicted by the VC dispersion for both
LJ argon and SW silicon 
with the VC-NMD and VC-ALD calculations for 
consistency and simplicity. We will examine 
the validity of this choice of group velocity in 
Section \ref{S:Diffusivities}.

%--------------------------------------------------------------------------

\subsubsection{\label{S:From VC Gamma}From VC-NMD and Gamma-NMD}
%--------------------------------------------------------------------------

Once the group velocities are predicted using the VC dispersion, 
the phonon mode lifetimes are required to predict the thermal 
conductivity using Eq. (\eqref{EQ:k_vib}). 
As an alternative to the VC-ALD models for predicting phonon lifetimes, 
which are discussed in the next section,  
we first use the normal mode decomposition (NMD) method.
\cite{ladd_lattice_1986,turney_predicting_2009} 
NMD maps the 
atomic trajectories (positions and velocities) of atoms in an MD 
simulation onto the vibrational normal mode coordinates,(cite)
\begin{equation}\label{EQ:q}
\begin{split}
q\kvt=&\SUM{0}{}\sqrt{\frac{m_b}{N}}u_{\alpha}\lbt e^*\kvba
\EXP{i\pmb{\kappa}\cdot\mathbf{r}_0\ab{l}{0}}
\end{split}
\end{equation}
and
\begin{equation}\label{EQ:qdot}
\begin{split}
\dot{q}\kvt{}{}{}=&\SUM{0}{}\sqrt{\frac{m_b}{N}}\dot{u}_{\alpha}
\lbt e^*\kvba\EXP{i\pmb{\kappa}\cdot\mathbf{r}_0\ab{l}{0}}.
\end{split}
\end{equation}
where $\mathbf{r}_0\ab{l}{0}$ are the equilibrium positions of the atoms 
in the $l$th unit cell of the lattice supercell under the VC 
approximation. 
The total energy of a given vibrational mode is 
\begin{equation}\label{A:E:qdot_HLD}
\begin{split}
E\kvt = \frac{\omega\kv^2}{2} q\kvt^*q\kvt + 
\frac{1}{2}\dot{q\kvt}^*\dot{q\kvt}
\end{split}
\end{equation}

We perform NMD using the frequencies and eigenvectors 
from both the VC ($\omega\kv$, $e\kvba$) and the Gamma supercell 
($\omega\kgv$, $e\kgvba$). 
The trajectories from 
these MD simulations are also used in the GK method 
(Section \ref{S:Thermal Conductivity}).
For the NMD method (Section \ref{S:From VC Gamma}), 
the atomic positions 
and velocities were sampled at a rate dictated by the highest vibrational 
frequencies in the system, which can be estimated from harmonic lattice 
dynamics calcualtions (Section \ref{S:VC Gamma DOS}). 

The MD simulations are performed using the package LAMMPS.
\cite{plimpton_fast_1995} The lengths of the MD simulations were longer 
than 10 times the longest phonon lifetime in the system. These can 
be estimated a priori from the VC-ALD predicted phonon lifetimes. For LJ 
argon and SW silicon, the simulations were run using time steps of 
$dt=0.002$ LJ units and $dt = 0.0005$ fs for $2^{20}$ and 
$2^{22}$ time steps and the atomic trajectories were sampled 
every $2^8$ and $2^4$ time steps, respectively. 
Ensemble averaging was performed using 10 independent initial 
randomized velocity distributions. 

The normal vibrational mode lifetime is predicted using 
\begin{equation}\label{EQ:tau_nmd}
\tau\kv = \int_{0}^{\TAU}
\frac{<E\kvt E\kvzero>}{ <E\kvzero E\kvzero> }dt,
\end{equation}
where the upper integration limit $\TAU$ is much larger than the phonon 
lifetime.(cite) For normal modes of the lattice supercell, 
Eq. \eqref{EQ:tau_nmd} is exact, but becomes an approximation when 
using non-exact normal modes to perform the mappings Eq.s 
\eqref{EQ:q} and \eqref{EQ:q}. An effective 
lifetime can be predicted using Eq. \eqref{EQ:tau_nmd}, 
even for larger disorder ($c=0.5$) 
where the energy autocorrelations 
are more complicated but generally follow exponential decay  
(see Appendix \ref{A:NMD XCORR}).  The phonon frequency cannot 
be predicted using Eq. \eqref{EQ:tau_nmd}, so the mode frequencies 
are taken to be those predicted by the VC dispersion.

The lifetimes predicted using VC-NMD and Gamma-NMD  
are shown in Fig. \ref{F:VC Gamma life} for LJ argon alloys at 
$T=$10 K.  
The range of frequencies of the modes for 
VC-NMD and Gamma-NMD differ slightly  
which is due to differences in the DOS (Fig. \ref{F:DOS}). 
For small intervals of frequency, there are a wider range of 
predicted lifetimes for Gamma-NMD. This is because there is no symmetry 
averaging of the mode properties, which is possible for the VC 
(Section \ref{S:VC Gamma DOS}).
Lifetimes predicted by both VC-NMD and Gamma-NMD show scalings of 
$\tau$ with 
frequency of $\omega^{-2}$ at low frequency and $\omega^{-4}$ and 
even faster for mid-range frequencies (Fig. \ref{F:VC Gamma life}). 
In general, the lifetimes predicted by both VC-NMD and Gamma-NMD  
are larger than the Ioffe-Regel (IR) limit,
\cite{taraskin_determination_1999} 
\begin{equation}\label{EQ:IR}
\tau = \frac{2\pi}{\omega}.
\end{equation}
The physical interpretation of the IR limit is that of a mode which 
scatters in a time equal to its oscillation period, which seems to 
be a good lower-limit for the lifetimes predicted by VC-NMD and Gamma-NMD 
for LJ argon (Fig. \ref{F:VC Gamma life}) 
and VC-NMD for SW silicon (Fig. \ref{F:Dph_si}(a)). 

The behavior at the highest frequencies, 
where $\tau ~ constant$, is seen for both VC-NMD and Gamma-NMD, 
except at $c=0.5$ for VC-NMD.  
Since the existence of this 
characteristic (thought not exactly minimum) lifetime for LJ argon is 
demonstrated by both VC-NMD and Gamma-NMD, it is physically 
meaningful. There is, however, no theoretical 
prediction of this high-frequency behavior of the mode lifetime.
\cite{kittel_interpretation_1949,cahill_lattice_1988,
graebner_phonon_1986}

Overall, good agreement is seen in the predicted lifetimes from VC-NMD and 
Gamma-NMD both in magnitude and trends. The use of the VC normal modes 
is an approximation which becomes worse as the concentration is increased 
(Appendix \ref{A:NMD XCORR}). 
The only approximation associated with Gamma-NMD is the use  
of the harmonic lattice dynamics predicted frequencies and eigenvectors 
to map the atomic trajectories from the fully anharmonic MD simulations, 
which has been shown to be valid at the low temperatures.
\cite{turney_predicting_2009} 
Based on the good agreement with Gamma-NMD, the 
lifetimes predicted by VC-NMD are used along with the VC predicted 
group velocities to 
predict thermal conductivity in Section \ref{S:Thermal Conductivity}.

Both $\omega^{-2}$ and $\omega^{-4}$ scalings can be observed 
at low frequencies, which are predicted by the peturbative models used 
for VC-ALD (Section \ref{S:From VC-ALD}). 
For both VC-NMD and Gamma NMD, most mode 
lifetimes are greater than the Ioffe-Regel limit $\tau = 2\pi/\omega$.

While there is more ``noise'' in the Gamma-NMD data

\subsubsection{\label{S:From VC-ALD}From VC-ALD}
%--------------------------------------------------------------------------

Assuming initrinsic and disorder scattering mechanisms 
to operate independently, the 
effective phonon lifetime can be found using Matthiessen's rule(cite),
\begin{equation}\label{EQ:Matthiessen}
\frac{1}{\tau\kv} = \frac{1}{\tau_{p-p}\kv} + \frac{1}{\tau_{p-d}\kv},
\end{equation}
where $\tau_{p-p}\kv$ accounts for intrinsic phonon-phonon scattering 
and $\tau_{p-d}\kv$ accounts for defect scattering.

Phonon-phonon scattering ($\tau_{p-p}\kv$) is typically treated 
using anharmonic perturbation theory (ALD) including only three-phonon 
processes.\cite{turney_predicting_2009,garg_role_2011,tian_phonon_2012} 
It has been demonstrated that the effects of higher order phonon 
processes become important at high temperatures.
\cite{ecsedy_thermal_1977,turney_predicting_2009} 
In this work, the intrinsic phonon lifetimes $\tau\kv_{p-p}$ 
are predicted using the method described in
\cite{turney_predicting_2009}, with all classical expressions to remain 
consistent with the classical MD-based methods NMD and GK. 

Using harmonic perturbation theory, Tamura derives a general expression 
for mass point defect scattering.\cite{tamura_isotope_1983} 
By considering the symmetry properties of the FCC lattices 
considered in this work (Section \ref{S:Calculation}), 
it can be shown that\cite{tamura_isotope_1983}
\begin{equation}\label{EQ:taud_dos}
\begin{split}
\frac{1}{\tau_{p-d}\kv} =\frac{\pi}{2} g_2 \omega^2\kv D(\omega), 
\end{split}
\end{equation}
where 
$D(\omega)$ is the density of states (Section \ref{S:VC Gamma DOS}) and 
\begin{equation}\label{EQ:gn}
\begin{split}
$g_n = \sum_\mu c^{\mu}(1-m^{\mu}/\bar{m}^{\mu})^n$.
\end{split}
\end{equation}
Here, $c^\mu$ is the concentration, 
$m^\mu$ is the mass of the $\mu$-th species 
and $\bar{m}^{\mu}$ is the average mass. Bond disorder 
can be accounted for using a similar expression with an average
atomic radius or suitable scattering cross-section.
\cite{klemens_scattering_1955,klemens_thermal_1957} 
For the binary LJ argon and SW silicon alloys considered, 
there is one atom type in the unit cell  
with $\mu=i,j$, so that the alloying atom labeled by $m^i_{1-c}$ 
can be considered to be an ``isotope'' of atom labeled 
$m^j_{c}$.  This convention is appropriate because isotopic 
impurities create perturbative disorder,\cite{tamura_isotope_1983} 
while we consider the use of Eq. \eqref{EQ:taud_dos} for 
large disorder.
To calculate the disordered lifetimes $\tau\kv_{d}$, 
it is necessary to broaden 
the $\delta$ function using a Lorentzian function.\footnote[2]{
For all calculations, the Lorentzian was broadened using a value of 
$100\delta_{\omega,avg}$ (Section \ref{S:SF}). 
For the system sizes here, 
the results do not differ significantly 
if this broadening value is varied manually or  
by increasing system size $N_0$.}

The lifetimes predicted by VC-ALD for LJ argon at $T=10$ K and 
$c=0.05$ are shown in Fig. \ref{F:Dph_lj} (a).  
At low frequencies where the density of states is Debye-like 
[$D(\omega) \propto \omega^{2}$, Fig. \ref{F:DOS}], 
$\tau_{p-p}\kv$ follows a general scaling of $\omega^{-2}$, which is due 
to intrinsic 3-phonon scattering processes.(cite)  
From Figs. \ref{F:VC Gamma life} and \ref{F:Dph_lj} (a) , 
the scaling $\tau \propto \omega^{-2}$ can be 
observed  
in the VC-NMD, Gamma-NMD and VC-ALD predicted results. 
Under the Debye-approximation , 
the phonon scattering due to mass point-defects 
is given by $A\omega^{-4}$, where $A$ is a constant related to the unit 
cell volume, branch-averaged group velocity, and disorder coupling strength 
($g_2(b)$, Eq. \eqref{EQ:gn}). 
The frequency dependence ($\omega^4$) is the same as 
Rayleigh scattering, which is valid at low frequency and observed 
in both the NMD (Fig. \ref{F:VC Gamma life}) and ALD 
(Fig. \ref{F:Dph_lj} (a)) predicted lifetimes. 
VC-ALD does not predict the behavior of the lifetimes at high frequency 
for LJ argon, $\tau ~ constant$. From Fig. \ref{F:Dph_lj} (c), the thermal 
conductivity frequency spectrum demonstrates that the conductivities of 
LJ argon and its alloys are dominated by high frequency modes 
(Fig. \ref{F:Dph_lj} c).(cite) It can be seen that VC-ALD underpredicts 
the thermal conductivity at high-frequencies, precisely where the lifetimes 
are underpredicted by VC-ALD compared to VC-NMD.

% The disorder 
% scattering scaling is expected to fall off faster than $\omega^{-4}$ 
% when $D(\omega)$ grows faster than the Debye scaling of 
% $\omega^{2}$ (Fig. , Section ). 
% The lifetimes do fall off faster $\omega^{-4}$ for the 
% mass disordered LJ FCC supercells for a narrow range of 
% frequencies near $\omega = 10$ in Fig. for $c=0.05,0.15$, 
% but seem to follow more closely $\omega^{-4}$ for $c=0.5$. 

The Tamura theory was developed to predict the reduction of lifetimes 
in isotopic Ge, which is only perturbatively disordered. 
The importance of n-order ($n > 2$) interactions in the 
Tamura theory become important with increasing disorder strength 
$g_n$ (Eq. \eqref{EQ:gn}).\cite{tamura_isotope_1983} 
For isotopically-disordered Ge, the higher-order contributions 
were estimated to be negligible for all 
frequencies.\cite{tamura_isotope_1983} 
For LJ argon and the large concentrations and mass ratios considered 
in this work, the terms higher order terms are order 1 and larger at high 
frequencies. It is possible that 
higher-order interactions in the Tamura theory 
are responsible for the 
discrepancy of the lifetimes predicted by VC-NMD and Gamma-NMD 
versus VC-ALD at high frequency.

\subsection{\label{S:Diffusivities}
Diffusivities}
%--------------------------------------------------------------------------

Once the group velocities and lifetimes are predicted, these can be used 
to predict the mode thermal 
diffusivity. For large disorder, 
only modes 
at low frequency have well-defined group velocities and lifetimes. 
At high frequencies it is not possible to 
specify a mode group velocity and lifetime independently,
\cite{feldman_numerical_1999,xu_energy_2009} and the mode thermal 
diffusivity must be considered.

In the classical harmonic limit, where the specific heat 
$c_p\kv = k_{\mathrm{B}}/V$, 
a vibrational mode's contribution to thermal 
conductivity is determined by the mode thermal diffusivity. For 
phonons, the thermal diffusivity is 
\begin{equation}\label{EQ:Dph}
D_{ph,\mathbf{n}}\kv = v_{g,\mathbf{n}}\kv \tau\kv.
\end{equation}
For VC-NMD and VC-ALD, $\pmb{v}_{g,\mathbf{n}}\kv$ is calculated 
from the VC dispersion (Section \ref{S:Dispersion}) so any differences in 
thermal diffusivity comes from the predicted lifetimes. The lower limit 
for phonon thermal diffusivity is 
$D_{ph,\mathbf{n}}\kv \approx 0$ since the 
group velocities can approch zero for modes such as optical 
and those near the Brioullin zone boundaries.(cite)

In disordered systems,  
modes can transport heat by harmonic coupling due to disorder 
in the Allen-Feldman (AF) theory of diffusons.\cite{allen_thermal_1993} 
In the high-scatter (HS) limit,(cite) 
the AF diffusivity of each mode is
\begin{equation}\label{EQ:M:k_HS}
D_{AF,HS} = \frac{1}{3} v_s a,
\end{equation}
which leads to the AF,HS limit prediction for thermal conductivity,  
Eq. \eqref{EQ:M:k_AF,HS}.\footnote[3]{
The Cahill-Pohl (CP) HS limit  
differs from the AF,HS model by a factor of approximately $\%20$.
\cite{cahill_lattice_1988}}
The physical interpretation is all vibrational 
modes transport heat at the sound speed 
and scatter with a mean free path of the lattice spacing. 
As seen in Fig. \ref{F:Dph_lj} for LJ argon alloy $c=0.05$, 
VC-NMD and VC-ALD predict from Eq. \eqref{EQ:Dph} a significant 
number of modes with  
$D_{ph}\kv < D_{AF,HS}$.  
This can lead to an underprediction of the 
total thermal conducitvity (Section ).

While AF,HS model assumes a mode-independent thermal diffusivity, 
the AF theory is capable of predicting the mode specific 
diffusivities.\cite{feldman_thermal_1993,feldman_thermal_1993,
feldman_numerical_1999,shenogin_predicting_2009} 
Since the AF theory is harmonic, mode diffusivities 
typically diverge as $\omega \rightarrow 0$ because
the vibrations are long-wavelength plane waves  
that weakly scattered by the disorder.
\cite{sheng_introduction_2006,vitelli_heat_2010}
\footnote[4]
{For the disordered lattices studied 
in this work for $c\le0.15$, the predicted $k_{AF}$ is strongly 
system size dependent, indicating this diverging behavior. 
For LJ argon alloys at $c=0.5$, the divergence with system size is 
small for the range of system size studied ($N_0=4$ to $N_0=12$), 
where $k_{AF}/k_{GK} = 0.93$ for $N_0=12$.} 
The mode-specific thermal diffusivities for the LJ argon amorphous phase 
are shown in Fig. \ref{F:AF}.
\footnote[5]{For a finite system, the AF theory 
requires a broadening in frequency to predict the mode-specific thermal 
diffusivities.  We use a Lorentzian broadening with a width of 
$\delta_{\omega,avg}$, see Section \ref{S:SF}.} 
Except at the highest frequencies, the thermal diffusivity of all modes 
can be modeled using a mode-independent 
diffusivity of approximately $D_{AF,HS}$. 
Also shown in Fig. \ref{F:AF} are the AF predicted thermal 
diffusivities for the explicitly disordered LJ argon superlattice 
and $c=0.5$. 
While the AF theory is divergent in the low-frequency limit for lattices,  
the finite system size limits the thermal diffusivities of the lowest 
frequencies. The thermal diffusivity of all 
modes in the explicitly disordered lattice supercell are 
larger than $D_{AF,HS}$, except 
at the highest frequencies where they tend to zero as in the amorphous 
phase.(cite) This result supports the plausible lower-bound of the 
VC predicted phonon thermal diffusivity, $D_{ph} \ge D_{AF,HS}$.

\subsection{\label{S:Mode Properties}
Mode Properties Discussion}
%--------------------------------------------------------------------------

For disordered systems it is only possible to assign a 
unique lifetime and group velocity to a vibrational mode 
only in the low-frequency, propagating limit.
\cite{feldman_numerical_1999,xu_energy_2009} 
This implies that the VC predicted group velocities, particluarly 
for $v_g\kv << v_s$ or $v_g\kv \approx 0$, 
are an underprediction of the representative 
velocity scale for the thermal diffusivity of high-frequency modes 
in the disordered lattice. 
Predictions from model 
disordered systems demonstrates the existence of a plateau of the 
thermal diffusivity, 
which is consistent with the minimum phonon mean-free path hyopthesis.
\cite{sheng_heat_1991} 
A minimum vibrational mean free path is used in most models of thermal 
transport in disordered materials.
\cite{kittel_interpretation_1949,cahill_lattice_1988,
graebner_phonon_1986} However, the concept of 
a vibrational mean free path is only valid for low-frequency propagating 
modes in disordered systems.\cite{feldman_numerical_1999} The more 
fundamental proprety is the vibrational mode lifetime
\cite{taraskin_determination_1999} and thermal diffusivity.
\cite{allen_thermal_1993,allen_diffusons_1999,
feldman_thermal_1993,feldman_numerical_1999}

VC-NMD and Gamma-NMD predicts lifetimes which 
are generally larger than the IR limit  
for LJ argon (Fig. \ref{F:VC Gamma life}.   
VC-ALD predicts essentially monotonically 
decreasing lifetimes with increasing frequency for both LJ argon 
(Fig. \ref{F:Dph_lj} (a)) 
Because VC-NMD and VC-ALD 
use the same predictions for $v_g\kv$, the phonon mode 
diffusivities $D_{ph}\kv$ are underpredicted for 
VC-ALD compared to VC-NMD for LJ argon alloys. 
There are thus 2 underpredictions to consider 
when predicting the thermal conductivities: 
underprediction 
of the thermal diffusivity assuming the VC group velocities for 
VC-NMD and VC-ALD, and the underprediction of the mode lifetimes for 
LJ argon alloys by 
the VC-ALD perturbative models. 

%--------------------------------------------------------------------------
\section{\label{S:Thermal Conductivity}Thermal Conductivity Predictions}
%--------------------------------------------------------------------------

The thermal conductivity can now be predicted using the 
vibrational mode properties 
predicted by the VC-NMD and VC-ALD 
methods.  Given the discussion of the VC-predicted mode properties 
in Section \ref{S:Mode Properties}, 
it is necessary to implement a third method 
for predicting thermal condudctivity. 
We choose the equilibirum MD-based green-kubo (GK) method(cite), which 
is a system-level method that 
does not predict any mode-specific properties. 
Thermal conductivities predicted by GK 
naturally capture the effects of whatever scattering 
meachanisms are 
present in the MD simulation without any assumptions.
\cite{skye_thermal_2008,landry_complex_2008,landry_effect_2009} 
For GK, the thermal conductivities are defined by the converged value of 
the integral of the heat current autocorrelation function for a given 
system size $N_0$. 

For LJ argon, bulk thermal conductivity predictions are made for 
VC-NMD, VC-ALD, and GK using a finite simulation size extrapolation 
procedure (Section \ref{S:Calculation}) 
and are shown in Fig. \ref{F:cond_lj}. 
For LJ argon, VC-NMD and VC-ALD underpredict the thermal 
conductivity compared to GK. 
The underprediction is only modest for VC-NMD, on the order of 
$20\%$ or less for all concentrations. 
Based on the limit $D_{AF,HS}$ (Eq. \eqref{EQ:M:k_HS}), the 
thermal diffusivities predicted by Eq. \eqref{EQ:Dph} for VC-ALD 
and VC-NMD can be adjusted such that any mode with 
$D_{ph} < D_{AF,HS}$ is given $D_{ph} = D_{AF,HS}$. 
The result of this adjustment, 
referred to as VC-NMD* and VC-ALD*, is shown in Fig. \ref{F:cond_lj}. 
The thermal conductivtiy predicted by VC-NMD$^*$ is 
brought 
into agreement with GK by approximately $10\%$ or less for all $c$. 
Combined with $D_{AF,HS}$, the VC-NMD predicted thermal 
diffusivities seem to be fair representations for the explicitly 
disordered modes present in the MD simulation.

The VC-ALD method underpredicts the thermal conductivity of LJ argon 
alloys, 
where 
the underprediction is worst for $c=0.05$, $k_{VC-ALD} / k_{GK} = 0.56$ 
(error bars are on the order 
of the large symbol sizes in Fig. \ref{F:cond_lj}). 
By applying the high-scatter limit 
adjustment VC-ALD$^*$, the thermal conductivities are brought into 
marginally 
better agreement, worst for $c=0.05$, $k_{VC-ALD^*} / k_{GK} = 0.65$. 
The VC-ALD method fails to 
accurately predict the high-frequency mode thermal diffusivities for 
LJ argon alloys, which can be seen in Fig. \ref{F:Dph_lj} (b).  
Since the group velocities are the same for VC-NMD and VC-ALD, 
the underprediction of the high-frequency thermal diffusivities, and 
hence thermal conductivity, is 
due to the underpediction of the high-frequency 
mode lifetimes (Fig. \ref{F:Dph_lj} (a)). Thus the adjustment 
$VC-ALD^*$ fails to bring VC-ALD into agreement with VC-NMD and GK. 

% The failure of the VC-ALD method can be demonstrated further 
% by moving to higher temerpature $T=40$ K in Fig. \ref{F:cond_lj} a.
% The beginning breakdown of the intrinsic phonon-phonon ($\tau_{p-p}\kw$) 
% scattering model 
% can be observed for $c=0.0$ at 
% $T=40$ K (Fig. \ref{F:cond_lj} b), 
% where ALD begins to overpredict compared to GK. 
% This 
% can be explained by the emerging importance of higher order (n$> 3$) 
% n-phonon process at high temperatures.\cite{turney_predicting_2009} 
% While the VC-ALD method begins to overpredict for $c=0.0$ 
% at elevated temperature, 
% it continues to underpredict for the alloys $c \ge 0.05$.  In fact, the 
% thermal conductivity predictions for VC-ALD are at or slightly below the  
% high-scatter limit $k_{AF,HS}$. 

% NOT USED:
% In SW silicon, the amorphous phase has significant contributions

\section{\label{S:SW}SW silicon}
%--------------------------------------------------------------------------

Becasue of the discrepancies between the VC-NMD VC-ALD predicted mode 
properties and thermal conductivity for LJ argon alloys (Section ), 
we predict the mode properties thermal conductivity for 
SW silicon alloys. Fig. \ref{F:Dph_si} (a) shows the lifetimes 
predicted by VC-NMD and VC-ALD. VC-NMD predicts lifetimes which 
are generally larger than the IR limit for SW silicon alloys, similar 
to VC-NMD predictions for LJ argon (Fig. ).   
Unlike LJ argon, VC-NMD and VC-ALD lifetime predictions agree over most 
of the frequency spectrum, except at the highest frequencies where 
VC-ALD underpredicts. While there is a plateau of the VC-NMD 
predicted mode lifetimes 
for LJ argon (Fig. ), this 
plateau of lifetimes at high-frequency is not seen for SW 
silicon (Fig. \ref{F:Dph_si} a). 

From Fig. \ref{F:Dph_si} (c) the thermal conductivity SW silicon alloys is 
dominated by 
low-frequency modes. As seen in Fig. \ref{F:Dph_lj} and \ref{F:Dph_si}, 
VC-NMD and VC-ALD predict from Eq. \eqref{EQ:Dph} significant 
number of modes with  
$D_{ph}\kv < D_{AF,HS}$ for both LJ argon and SW silicon. However, 
because thermal transport in SW silicon is low-frequency dominant, 
the high-scatter adjustments VC-NMD$^*$ and VC-ALD$^*$ vary by only 
approximately one percent compared to the unadjusted VC-NMD and VC-ALD. 

For SW silicon, bulk thermal conductivity 
predictions can only be made for VC-ALD and GK (Fig. \ref{F:cond_si}) 
because of the 
limited system size used for VC-NMD 
(see Section ).
For SW silicon, the thermal conductivities predicted by VC-ALD and GK 
are in better agreement, even without the adjustment VC-ALD$^*$. VC-ALD 
actually overpredicts by roughly $20\%$ for $c \ge 0.05$ compared to GK.
\footnote[6]
{The overprediction of thermal conductivity by VC-ALD 
may be related to the role of disorder in the ALD calculation.
\cite{garg_role_2011,turney_predicting_2009} While Garg et al found 
an overprediction of VC-ALD compared to experiment by a factor of two, 
the overprediction 
we observe in this work for SW silicon alloys is not as drastic.}   

For LJ argon and the large concentrations and mass ratios considered 
in this work, the terms higher order terms are order 1 and larger at high 
frequencies. 
For SW silicon alloys the higher-order terms are also large, while 
good agreement is observed at all but the highest frequencies 
for VC-NMD and VC-ALD (Fig. \ref{F:Dph_si} (a)). 
It is possible that 
higher-order interactions in the Tamura theory 
are also responsible for the 
discrepancy of the lifetimes predicted by VC-NMD and VC-ALD in SW silicon, 
but this discrepancy is unimportant to the overall
thermal transport.

\section{\label{S:Discussion}Thermal Properties Discussion}
%--------------------------------------------------------------------------

The LJ argon and SW silicon alloys studied in this work 
have different ranges of phonon frequencies, 
lifetimes, group velocities and total thermal conductivity. 
For bulk silicon(cite), the thermal conductivity 
is dominated by low-frequency modes(cite), which is also true for 
bulk and alloyed SW silicon (Fig. \ref{F:Dph_si}).(cite) For SW silicon, 
VC-ALD predicts thermal conductivities in reasonably 
good agreement with the 
explicitly disordered GK method (Fig. \ref{F:cond_si}).  
For LJ argon, VC-ALD underpredicts 
the high-frequency phonon lifetimes and thermal diffusivities 
(Fig. \ref{F:Dph_lj}), 
leading to an underprediction of 
thermal conductivity when compared to VC-NMD and GK 
(Section \ref{S:Thermal Conductivity}). 

The results for SW silicon and LJ argon alloys suggest that 
the thermal modeling of ordered and 
disordered lattices can be separated into two broad groups: 
low-frequency dominated and full-spectrum materials.(cite) 
Materials dominated 
by low-frequency modes tend to have high thermal conductivities, 
which is due to their large group velocities and long lifetimes.
(cite) These low-frequency modes  
follow closely the scalings predicted by the perturbative VC-ALD 
models, which are valid at low-frequencies. 

LJ argon is a material whose thermal transport has significant 
contribution from high-frequency modes, even for the bulk 
(Fig. \ref{F:Dph_lj} (c)). 
This high-frequency range is where the perturbative Tamura theory 
is predicted to have non-negligible contributions from higher-order 
interactions (Section \ref{S:From VC-ALD}). 
While the 
high-order interactions in the Tamura theory are also predicted to be 
non-negligible for SW silicon, this does not affect the thermal 
conductivty predictions signifcantly. Even though VC-ALD underpredcits 
the mode lifetimes and thermal diffusivities at very high frequencies 
for SW silicon alloys (Fig. \ref{F:Dph_si},  
these modes 
are unimportant to thermal transport. This is also 
true for the thermal conductivity spectrum of SiGe alloys 
from first-princples predictions\cite{garg_role_2011} and experimental 
measurements.\cite{abeles_thermal_1962,cahill_thermal_2004,
cahill_thermal_2005,cheaito_experimental_2012} 
For example, the thermal conductivity of SiGe alloys
exceeds the high-scatter limit by more than
an order of magnitude at room temperature for all com-
positions.(cite)

The breakdown of the perturbative VC-ALD models for LJ argon 
is  considering the thermal diffusivity of vibrational 
modes in the AF theory. 
A simple correction to the VC approximation can be made by considering 
a high-scatter limit for the mode specific thermal 
diffusivity (Section \ref{S:Diffusivities}). 
This high-scatter limit is physically interpreted as vibrational modes 
propagating at the sound speed a distance of the lattice constant. 
However, the concept of a vibrational mean free path 
in a disordered system is only valid at low-frequencies.
\cite{feldman_numerical_1999,xu_energy_2009} For 
disordered vibrations, the lifetime and thermal diffusivity are the 
fundamental quantities. 

% The VC approximation underpredicts 
% the mode thermal 
% diffusivity due to disorder because the group velocities $v_g\kv$ can 
% approach zero (Section ), though this is a small effect compared to 
% the underprediction of the lifetimes by VC-ALD. 

For LJ argon, it is possible that the VC group velocities are an 
over-prediction for modes in a given interval of frequency, 
an effect which is compensated for 
by a small under-prediction of the lifetimes in the same interval of 
frequency when compared to Gamma-NMD (Fig. \ref{F:VC Gamma life}). 
The VC-NMD predicted 
mode lifetimes and thermal diffusivity adjusted VC-NMD$^*$, 
predict thermal conducitivities in good agreement with 
the MD-based GK method. 
Based on the thermal conductivity predictions for VC-NMD$^*$ and 
the well-defined peaks in the structure factors 
(Fig. \ref{F:SF}), the reduction of group velocities in 
disordered lattices 
due to zone folding seems to be an underprediction of the group 
velocity of moderate to high frequency modes.\cite{duda_reducing_2011}  

% As observed by Kittel, if the sound
% velocity is used instead of U; and the interatomic spacing
% is used instead of the mean free path l;, then tc( T) is qual-
% itatively and semiquantitatively
% fit at temperatures above
% the plateau region.
% In fact, Slack showed that the same model 
% is useful for crystalline insulators with strong scattering.(waiting for 
% ILL).\cite{henry_ehrenreich_thermal_1979}

% The theory by Tamura is able to treat disorder scattering in an arbitrary 
% crystal with dispersion. The theory, however, fails to predict the 
% lifetimes of high-frequency modes, which are critical to the total 
% thermal conductivity in LJ argon (see Fig. and ). To match the predicted 
% phonon lifetime at high fequency for $c=0.05$ 
% ($\tau\kv \propto const.$, Fig. ), 
% the Tamura theory (to order 2, $g_2(b)$) requires a DOS which scales as 
% $D(\omega\kv) \propto const.$. Clearly from Fig. , this is not the case 
% with either the VC or Gamma modes. To match the predicted 
% phonon lifetime at high fequency for $c=0.5$ 
% ($\tau\kv \propto 1/\omega\kv$, Fig. , also true for all $c$ in SW silicon), 
% The higher-order terms in the Tamura theory are demonstrated to be large 
% in Fig., but it is unclear if and how they are responsible for the 
% underpredictions of the VC-ALD method for LJ argon. 

% While Broido found that omission of optical scattering overpredicts 
% the thermal 
% conductivity of bulk Si by a factor of 2-3, 
% optical modes contribute less than $5\%$ 
% to thermal conductivity itself. Similarly, the diffusivity adjusted 
% thermal 
% cobductivities of SW Si are increased by less then about $1\%$, 
% demonstrating the 
% the high frequency and optical modes are also unimportant to thermal 
% transport 
% in Si alloys. 

% For the perfect system, phonon modes with nearly zero group velocity 
% (optical modes and acoustic modes at the BZ boundaries) have essentially 
% zero thermal diffusivity and contribute nearly 
% nothing to the thermal transport, while the modes themselves 
% are important to the 
% scattering of other phonons.(cite) In the disordered lattices under the 
% AF theory, modes important to thermal transport have a finite thermal 
% diffusivity, as opposed to  the minimum $D_{th} \approx 0 $ for phonons 
% in a perfect lattice. This finite thermal diffusivity limit is the cause 
% for the large (LJ argon Fig. ) and small (SW silicon Fig. ) 
% descrepcny between the thermal conductivity prdictions of VC-ALD and 
% VC-NMD versus 

% High thermal conductivity materials tend to have a conductivity spectrum 
% which is peaked in the low frequency range.(cite) 
% It is in this range where the mode 
% lifetimes follow closely the scalings with frequency which can be 
% predicted by the perturbative models for intrinsic and disorder 
% scattering as 
% (Section Eq. ).

% In contrast, 
% in LJ argon the high frequency phonon mode properties are critical 
% to the thermal transport.(cite)  
% While the low frequency phonon properties predicted by VC-NMD and 
% VC-ALD agree, it is the failure of the perturbative models at 
% high frequency which causes VC-ALD to underpredict. The failure 
% to account for harmonic disordered scattering due to the AF theory 
% is responsible for causing both VC-NMD and VC-ALD to underpredict 
% versus GK, which affects the high frequency modes significantly. 
% LJ argon, with lower 
% frequencies, lifetimes, and group velocities compared to 
% ``stiff'' SW silicon, 
% is considered a ``soft'' system. 

% For SW silicon, the low frequency modes dominate thermal transport 
% even in the heavily disordered alloy.(cite new Hopkins) 
% It is thus unsurprising that predictions for 
% SW silicon using VC-ALD agree well with VC-NMD and GK. This is also a 
% plausible explanation for the success of predictions using 
% VC-ALD and ab initio calculations compared to experiment for 
% ``stiff'' systems (i.e. Si-Ge).(cite)

\section{\label{S:Summary}Summary}
%--------------------------------------------------------------------------

The concept of simple alloying remains at the forefront of efforts  
to control or minimize the thermal conductivity of semiconducting and 
thermoeletric materials (cite SiGe nanoporous, PbTe) 
Results in this work suggest that the lower limit for the vibrational 
mode thermal diffusivity in alloys is $(1/3)v_sa$. 

The results in this work support the idea of a minimum thermal diffusivity 
for the vibrations in disordered lattices.(cite) 
Although this minimum thermal 
diffusivity is usually interpreted as a minimum mean free path, we find 
that concept is not necessary for interpreting the results of this work. 
The VC 
approximation provides a computationally cheap framework, which is 
essential for expensive but experimentally accurate \emph{ab initio} 
methods for predicting thermal conductivity.(cite) 
The high-scatter limit 
of thermal diffusivity is more useful for examing the thermal transport 
in alloys under the framework of the VC approximation. The 
fundamental quantity is the mode lifetimes and the group velocity 
is an approximation, and expressed together as thermal diffusivity 
they can be interpreted in the presence of disorder.

The VC approximation results in two 
underpredictions for modes at high frequencies: 
(i) underprediction of the disordered vibrational 
thermal diffusivities because of the VC predicted group velocities, 
and (ii) underprediction of the disordered mode lifetimes by 
the perturbative VC-ALD method. 
The validity of the VC approxiation has been verified for SW silicon 
alloys, which is a model system dominated by low-frequency modes. 
The underprediction of both the 
mode group velocities by the VC and the lifetimes by VC-ALD 
occurs at the highest 
frequencies for SW silicon alloys, but these modes are unimportant 
to thermal transport. 
This is the plausible explanation for the success of the VC 
approximation phenomologically and predictively for low-frequency 
dominated, high thermal conductivity materials.(cite)

For LJ argon alloys, which have significant thermal transport 
from high-frequency modes, VC-NMD and VC-ALD both underpredcit the 
thermal conductivity compared to the system-level GK method. 
VC-NMD underpredicts only modestly, and can be brough into good 
agreement with GK by applying the high-scatter limit adjustment 
VD-NMD$^*$. For VC-ALD, the high-scatter limit adjustment VC-ALD$^*$ 
still underpredicts compared to GK and VC-NMD$^*$, suggesting that 
the perturbative Tamura theory is not appropriate for LJ argon alloys. 
This may be true for the high-frequency modes of any disordered 
lattice,(cite) and the high-scatter limit $D_{AF,HS}$ should be 
considered whenever the perturbative VC-ALD method is used.

% Computational Cost}
% %--------------------------------------------------------------------------
% 
% The key to incorporating the effects of disorder explicitly are the use 
% of a large disordered supercells (Section \ref{S:Calculation}). 
% However, the methods used 
% in this work scale differently with the size of the supercell considered. 
% The calculations in this work are trivially parallelizable\cite{} 
% except the 
% MD simulations\cite{plimpton_fast_1995} and the eigenvalue solution of the 
% Dynamical matrix.\cite{gale_general_2003} Efficient MD 
% codes scale linearly with the number of atoms in the system $N_a$, making 
% the GK method an efficient method for predicting thermal conductivity. 
% However, the computational cost of using large supercells for MD simulation, 
% particularly because of the large number of time steps required 
% (on the order of $10^5 - 10^7$ depending on the 
% system, time step used, etc (cite)), prohibit its use with typical 
% \emph{ab initio} methods such as 
% plane-wave Density Functional Theory.(cite) 
% 
% Both VC-NMD and VC-ALD require the eigenvalue solution 
% of a Dynamical matrix of size $(3n,3n)$ for each irreducible wavevector 
% of the system size considered, 
% which is negligible compared to the other 
% caculations required for both of these methods.(cite) 
% The Gamma-NMD (Section \ref{S:VC Gamma life}) and 
% AF theory (Section \ref{S:Diffusivities}) 
% require the eigenvalue solution of a large Dynamical matrix $(3N_a,3N_a)$, 
% the solution of which scales as $(3N_a)^3$. 
% The AF theory is limited 
% to small supercells using ab initio calculations, making it difficult 
% to asses finite-size effects.(cite)  
% 
% Using the VC-ALD method, the symmetries of the system can be 
% used to drastically reduce the required computations, permitting its 
% use with ab initio methods.
% \cite{esfarjani_method_2008,turney_predicting_2009,
% esfarjani_heat_2011,chaput_phonon-phonon_2011} 
% For VC-ALD, the calculation of the intrinsic phonon 
% lifetimes $\tau_{p-p}\kv$ scales as $n^4$,\cite{turney_predicting_2009}  
% making calcualtions for large unit cells challenging.(cite) 
% Compared to 
% the calculation of the intrinsic phonon lifetimes, calculation 
% of the defect lifetimes $\tau_d\kv$ (Eq. ) is negligible.

% Consider the following computational times for the methods used in 
% this work for LJ argon and $N_0 = 12$. All calculations were performed 
% on the same computing cluster and include the effect of using 
% multiple processors (for example the VC-ALD calculations were run using 
% 12 cpu for 4.1 hours):
% 
% AF = eigenvalue solution + thermal diffusivity calculation = 4.2 hours
% 
% VC-ALD time = 49.2 hours?
% 
% VC-NMD time = 102 hours for MD + 780 hours for NMD + negligible time 
% to generate phonon frequencies and eigenvectors
% 
% LJ VC-Gamma = MD simulation + NMD + eigenvalue solution =  
% 102 hours + 780 hours + 3.8 hours =

\section{\label{A:NMD XCORR}
NMD using Non-Exact Normal Modes}
%--------------------------------------------------------------------------

For a normal mode of the lattice supercell 
used for the MD simulations, 
the autocorrelation of the total 
normal mode enery autocorrelations are damped exponentials 
with a decay time $\tau\kv$ and the kinetic energy autocorrelation is a 
cosinusodial exponentially-damped oscillation with frequency 
$2\omega\kv$.(cite AHRT)   
When using the VC normal modes to map the MD simulation 
trajectories from the explicitly disordered lattice supercells, 
the mode total and kinetic energy autocorrelation fucntions 
do not always follow the simple functional forms, 
see Fig. \ref{F:NMD XCORR} (a) and (b). 
By calculating the phonon mode spectral 
energy $\Phi$, which is a phonon mode energy method in the  
frequency-domain,\cite{larkin_comparison_2012} artifacts such as 
multiple peaks in a given mode's 
energy spectrum $\Phi$ can be observed for high concentrations,  
$c=0.5$, Fig. \ref{F:NMD XCORR} (a).   

These artifacts in the mode energy spectrum and autocorrelations 
are not surprising 
given two considerations: 
(i) the MD simulations 
contain explicit disorder which incluences the atomic trajectories, 
(ii)
the VC normal modes are not the exact normal modes and of the 
explicitly disordered lattice supercells. 
It is important to remember that the VC normal modes 
are exact in the limit $c->0$. 

In the case 
of multiple peaks in the VC phonon mode spectrum $\Phi$, 
the choice of which peak to fit to predict the phonon 
properties can be ambiguous. An effective lifetime can be predicted 
unambiguously using Eq. \eqref{EQ:tau_nmd} 
because the VC phonon mode autocorrelations 
still decay to zero in a finite time, Fig. \ref{F:NMD XCORR} (b). 
This results is to be expected 
given that the atomic trajectories contain 
information about the lattice energy, which from general statistical 
physics principles will have exponential relaxation behavior in an 
equillibrium ensemble.

% \section{\label{A:SF}Calculation of the Gamma Mode Structure Factors}
% %--------------------------------------------------------------------------
% 
% To calculate 
% $S^{L,T}\kw$ for a finite-size system, the 
% delta function in Eq. \eqref{EQ:M:SLT} is broadened using a Lorentzian 
% function with a full-width at half maximum 
% $\Gamma_{FMHW} = \delta_{\omega,avg}$, 
% where 
% $\delta_{\omega,avg}$ is the average frequency spacing. 
% Allen et al\cite{allen_diffusons_1999} 
% demonstrated using a model of 
% a-Si that the structure factor 
% for large wavevector broadens so that the 
% linewidth $\Gamma_{SF} > \omega$.
% \cite{taraskin_determination_1999}
% For the systems sizes studied, $\Gamma_{SF}$ 
% scale with the brodening factor 
% $\Gamma_{FMHW}$ for all peaks 
% except those at high frequencies. 
% 
% For the range of broadening factors 
% considered ($\Gamma_{FMHW} = \delta_{\omega,avg}$ to $50\delta_{\omega,avg}$) 
% the linedwidths extracted for all $c$ 
% generally satisfy $\Gamma_{SF} > \omega$. 
% For all broadening factors, the linewidths 
% (inverse lifetimes, $\tau_{SF} = 1/2\Gamma_{SF}$) 
% at high frequency are in better 
% agreement with the lifetimes predicted 
% by VC-NMD rather than VC-ALD,
% where generally $\tau > 2\pi/\omega$ 
% (IR limit, Fig. \ref{F:VC Gamma life}).
% \cite{taraskin_determination_1999} This gives more  
% justification for the use of the VC predicted group velcoities for 
% both VC-NMD and VC-ALD, even for large wavevector and $c$. 
% 
% In general, the polarization of the eigenvectors $e\kvba$ will not 
% be purely transverse or logitudinal along the reciprocal directions. 
% Even for the simple LJ argon system, this can make it difficult to 
% uniquely identify then different polarizations with the various 
% peaks in the structure factors. For SW silicon, similar good agreement 
% can be seen along the high symmetry directions for the acoustic branches, 
% while the optical modes 
% and more complicated polarizations are too difficult to identify in 
% an automated way. 
% In general, the acoustic branches can be identified, provided they are 
% well separated in frequency from any optical branches.

% \section{\label{A:Finite Simulation}
% Finite Simulation-Size Scaling for Thermal 
% Conductivity}
% %--------------------------------------------------------------------------
% To predict a bulk thermal conductivity, extrapolation is used by the 
% following finite size scaling $ 1 / k \propto 1/N_0$. For VC-NMD and 
% VC-ALD, the validity of the finite-size scaling 
% requires the low frequency modes in the finite system to be dominated by 
% intrinsic scattering ($\tau\kv \propto \omega\kv^{-2}$) and  
% follow the Debye approximation 
% with respect to $v_{g,\mathbf{n}}$ and DOS $D(\omega\kv)$.
% \cite{shiomi_thermal_2011,esfarjani_heat_2011} For LJ 
% argon, this requirement is satisfied for modest system sizes 
% (for $N_0 = 6$ to $12$) so that both VC-NMD and VC-ALD predictions 
% can be extrapolated to a bulk value. 
% For SW silicon, the thermal conductivity is dominated by low-frequency 
% modes (Fig. \ref{F:Dph_si}). Becasue of this, large system sizes 
% (up to $N_0 = 42$) are needed to satsify the 
% extrpaolation requirements and only VC-ALD can be used.(cite) This 
% demonstrates the computational efficieny of the VC-ALD method which is 
% necessary when computationally expensive 
% ab initio methods are used (Section ).
% \cite{garg_role_2011,tian_phonon_2012,
% lindsay_thermal_2012,esfarjani_heat_2011}
% 
% System sizes of up to $N_0=38$ are required to predict converged 
% thermal conductivity of SW silicon alloys. 
% For Si modeled using the Tersoff potential, 
% system sizes of up to 64000 atoms are required to observe 
% converged values of thermal conductivity using the GK method.
% \cite{he_lattice_2012} We find that similar system sizes are 
% also required for 
% 
% For the GK method, smaller system sizes $N_0 \le 12$ are used for the 
% finite size extrapolation for LJ argon and SW silicon . 
% The validity of this result can be explained in terms of a 
% combination of effects which are specific to the MD simulations.
% \cite{esfarjani_heat_2011} In fact, for $c=0$ the GK results are 
% independent of system size for $N_0 = 4$ to $N_0 = 12$ for LJ argon.
