\@doendnote{endnote\protect \ensuremath  {*}}{For the disordered lattices studied in this work for $c\le 0.15$, the predicted $k_{AF}$ is strongly system size dependent, indicating this diverging behavior. For LJ argon alloys at $c=0.5$, the divergence with system size is small for the range of system size studied ($N_0=4$ to $N_0=12$), where $k_{AF}/k_{GK} = 0.93$ for $N_0=12$.}
\@doendnote{endnote\protect \ensuremath  {\dagger }}{For a finite system, the AF theory requires a broadening in frequency to predict the mode-specific thermal diffusivities. We use a Lorentzian broadening with a width of $\delta _{\omega ,avg}$, see Section \ref {S:SF}.}
\@doendnote{endnote\protect \ensuremath  {\ddagger }}{Analysis of these high-frequency modes shows that they are locons, modes which are spatially localized in the Anderson sense. Feldman et al showed that the thermal diffusivities in a-Si show a sharp breakpoint at the on- set of localized states, where it tends to zero exponentially. The correct length scale associated with these modes is the mode correlation length(cite), whose uppper bound is the size of the simulation domain.}
\@doendnote{endnote\protect \ensuremath  {\mathsection }}{The overprediction of thermal conductivity by VC-ALD may be related to the role of disorder in the ALD calculation. \cite {garg_role_2011,turney_predicting_2009} While Garg et al found an overprediction of VC-ALD compared to experiment by a factor of two, the overprediction we observe in this work for SW silicon alloys is not as drastic.}
