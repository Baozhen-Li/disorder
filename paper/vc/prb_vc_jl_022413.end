\@doendnote{endnote\protect \ensuremath  {\dagger }}{ For all calculations, the Lorentzian was broadened using a value of $100\delta _{\omega ,avg}$ (Section \ref {S:SF}). For the system sizes here, the results do not differ significantly if this broadening value is varied manually or by increasing system size $N_0$.}

\@doendnote{endnote\protect \ensuremath  {\mathsection }}{For the disordered lattices studied in this work for $c\le 0.15$, the predicted $k_{AF}$ is strongly system size dependent, indicating this diverging behavior. For LJ argon alloys at $c=0.5$, the divergence with system size is small for the range of system size studied ($N_0=4$ to $N_0=12$), where $k_{AF}/k_{GK} = 0.93$ for $N_0=12$.}
\@doendnote{endnote\protect \ensuremath  {\mathparagraph }}{For a finite system, the AF theory requires a broadening in frequency to predict the mode-specific thermal diffusivities. We use a Lorentzian broadening with a width of $\delta _{\omega ,avg}$, see Section \ref {S:SF}.}
\@doendnote{endnote\protect \ensuremath  {**}}{The overprediction of thermal conductivity by VC-ALD may be related to the role of disorder in the ALD calculation. \cite {garg_role_2011,turney_predicting_2009} While Garg et al found an overprediction of VC-ALD compared to experiment by a factor of two, the overprediction we observe in this work for SW silicon alloys is not as drastic.}
