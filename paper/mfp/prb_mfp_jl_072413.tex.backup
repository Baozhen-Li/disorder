\begin{abstract}

Understanding thermal transport in crystalline systems requires detailed 
knowledge of phonons, which are the quanta of energy associated with 
atomic 
vibrations. By definition, phonons are non-localized vibrations that 
propagate energy over distances much larger than the atomic spacing. For 
disordered materials (e.g., alloys, amorphous phases), with the 
exception 
of very long-wavelength (low-frequency) modes, the vibrational modes are 
non-propagating. The film thickness and temperature dependence 
of thermal conductivity measured by experiments show 
(indirectly) that propagating modes contribute 
significantly to thermal conductivity for a-Si but not a-SiO2. 
Recent measurements by Regner et al. using a 
broadband FDTR technique argue that these propagating vibrational 
mean free paths can 
be probed to measure the 
thermal conductivity accumulation function for a-SiO2 and a-Si.   
Using lattice dynamics calculations and molecular dynamics simulations 
on 
realistic models of a-SiO2 and a-Si, we predict and 
characterize the contributions from propagating and non-propagating 
vibrations 
to thermal conductivity. The vibrational mean free paths are 
predicted for a-SiO2 and a-Si and the thermal 
conductivity accumulation function is compared with experimental 
broadband FDTR and varying thin film thicknesses measurements. 
For a-SiO2, the propagating modes are found to contribute 
negligibly for both bulk and thin film a-SiO2. We demonstrate using 
(to our knowledge) the largest model of bulk a-Si the scaling 
of the low frequency mode thermal diffusivities.  
Comparison of our model with 
the widely-varying experimental measurements  
show that the scaling of low-frequency mode diffusivities in a-Si 
thin films are well-described by our model 
of bulk a-Si $\emph{and}$ a scaling based on point defects. Further  
experiments are needed to understand how the low-frequency scaling 
of mode diffusivity varies with a-Si thin film thicknesses 
and preparation technique and suggestions are given based on 
the results from this work.

BEGINALAN

Amorphous silicon (a-Si) and nanocrystalline silicon have applications 
in high-efficiency solar cells.(cite) 
Films and substrates made of a-SiO2 and a-Si have wide application in 
semiconductor and optoelectronic devices.
(cite) Understanding the thermal transport in these amorphous systems 
is critical to improving their performance. 
Thermal transport at scales comparable to phonon wave-
lengths and mean free paths (MFPs) is presently a topic of
considerable interest for both crystalline and amorphous materials.
\cite{cahill_nanoscale_2003,
yu_reduction_2010,hochbaum_enhanced_2008,pernot_precise_2010}
Recently, nanostructured materials
such as nanowires, superlattices, and composites with
strongly reduced thermal conductivities due to phonon
scattering at interfaces and boundaries.
\cite{hochbaum_enhanced_2008,pernot_precise_2010,
boukai_silicon_2008,poudel_high-thermoelectric_2008} Recently, 
experimental measurements of the thermal conductivity of amorphous 
materials such as a-Si and amorphous SiN demonstrate that 
propagating (phonon-like) mode contribute significantly to thermal 
transport.(cite) However, the contribution of propagating modes to 
thermal 
transport in these amorphous materials is still not well understood.
(cite)

Traditionally, empirical expressions and
simple models have been the only means
to estimate MFPs in crystalline\cite{holland_analysis_1963} 
and amorphous materials.(cite)   
Experimentally, inelastic neutron scattering has been
used to measure phonon lifetimes in materials,
but this technique is more suited for single crystal samples.
\cite{christianson_phonon_2008} 
An x-ray diffraction and thermoreflectance technique
can measure ballistic transport in some structures, but is 
not well-suited for amorphous thin films.
\cite{highland_ballistic-phonon_2007} 
Koh et al. proposed a time-domain thermal reflectance (TDTR) 
technique with variation of
modulation frequency to probe the low-frequency MFPs in 
crystals and alloys,
\cite{koh_frequency_2007} 
but this technique is limited by the modulation frequency 
and the theoretical understanding of the technique.
(cite JAP paper) 
Studies have also been performed using  
frequency-domain thermal reflectance (FDTR) techniques 
to probe the accumulation function for bulk 
crystalline materials.\cite{minnich_thermal_2011,yang_mean_2013} 
Broadband FDTR measurements by Regner argue that the thermal 
conductivity accumulation function for a-SiO2 and a-Si  
can be measured by varying the penetration depth of the 
experimental measurement.\cite{regner_broadband_2013}
However, understanding 
of the thermal conductivity accumulation function in amorphous 
materials is still not well understood.
\cite{feldman_thermal_1993,cahill_thermal_1994,
feldman_numerical_1999,liu_high_2009,yang_anomalously_2010,
he_thermal_2011}

Understanding the thermal conductivity accumulation function 
requires an understanding of the low-frequency propagating 
modes and the scaling of their MFPs with 
frequency.(cite) 
Experimental measurements of the thermal conductivity of
thin films of a-SiO2 and a-Si at varying temperatures 
gives indirect information about the low-frequency propagating 
modes.(cite) For a-SiO2, 
varying temperature 
and film thickness
\cite{lee_heat_1997,yamane_measurement_2002} 
measurements all suggest that the propagating modes 
contribute a negligible amount to thermal conductivity. 
However, the behavior of the low-frequency modes 
has only recently been understood by experimental 
measurements.
\cite{masciovecchio_evidence_2006,baldi_thermal_2008,
baldi_sound_2010,baldi_elastic_2011,baldi_emergence_2013} 
For a-Si the low-frequency behavior of the MFPs is less understood.
(cite) 
Temperature-varying(cite) and film thickness-varying measurements
\cite{pompe_thermal_1988,cahill_thermal_1989,hasselman_thermal_1989,
kuo_thermal_1992,feldman_thermal_1993,cahill_thermal_1994,
wada_thermal_1996,feldman_numerical_1999,
moon_thermal_2002,zink_thermal_2006,zink_excess_2006,liu_high_2009,
yang_anomalously_2010}
suggest multiple, different behavior of the low-frequency 
scaling of the mean free paths of vibrational modes in a-Si. 

In this work, we perform Molecular Dynamics (MD) simulations and 
Lattice Dynamics calculations on large, realistic atomistic models 
of bulk a-SiO2 and a-Si. Large MD 
simulations of models for bulk and thin-film a-SiO2 show that 
propagating modes 
do not make a significant contribution to thermal conductivity. 
This is confirmed by a ``bottom-up``, mode-by-mode analysis.  
We predict the thermal conductivity of bulk a-Si using (to our 
knowledge) the largest MD simulation for a model of a-Si.(cite) 
Scaling 
of thermal conductivity with system size indicates that the 
low-frequency propagating modes in bulk a-Si contribute significantly 
to thermal conductivity. 
A ''bottom-up`` analysis of a large a-Si model supports the evidence 
that propagating 
modes contribute to the thermal 
conductivity of a-Si in an amount similar to that predicted by 
other models of a-Si(cite) and experimental results.(cite) 
The results are used to 
understand the recent experimental measurements of Regner et al. 
using broadband FDTR with varying 
penetration depths $L_p$.\cite{regner_broadband_2013}



Recent broadband frequency domain thermal-reflectance experiments 
by Regner et al. measured how the thermal conductivity of a-SiO2 and 
a-Si thin films change with the penetration depth associated with the 
heating laser pulse. For a-SiO2, the thermal conductivity of a 1000 nm 
film did not vary for penetration depths between 57 and 960 nm, 
suggesting that any propagating modes that contribute to thermal 
conductivity have MFPs below 57 nm. For a-Si, they find the 
thermal conductivities of thin films between 500 and 2000 nm 
vary by about 
40$\%$ for penetration depths between 44 and 968 nm, suggesting 
that propagating modes with MFPs of 100 to 1000 nm contribute 
significantly to thermal conductivity.\cite{regner_broadband_2013}  
Following the suggestion of Koh and Cahill, they interpret the 
measured value at a given penetration depth to be representative 
of the phonons with MFP less than that value, allowing for the 
construction of the so-called thermal conductivity accumulation 
function. Their results are plotted in Fig. \ref{FIG:sio2_accum} 
for a 1000 nm thick film of a-SiO2 
and in Fig. \ref{FIG:si_accum} for 500 nm (Regner A) and 
2000 nm (Regner B) thick films for a-Si.\cite{regner_broadband_2013} 



The spectrum of vibrational MFPs and the accumulated thermal conductivity
(cite) 
are predicted for a-SiO2 and a-Si. The thermal conductivity for our model 
of a-SiO2 explains the results of the experimental measurements 
of Regner et al, which show no measured dependence of the thermal 
conductivity on $L_p$,\cite{regner_broadband_2013} and experimental 
measurements of the thermal conductivity of thin films which 
show no dependence on film thickness.(cite) 
Using a simple boundary scattering model, the accumulated thermal 
conductivity of a-Si thin films are predicted from our model 
of bulk a-Si. The predicted accumulated thermal conductivity 
reproduces the experimentally measured penetration depth-dependent 
thermal conductivity qualitatively.(cite) We consider two different 
scalings of the low-frequency MFPs based on our atomistic models 
and show that each scaling passes reasonably well through the 
various experimental measurements.
\cite{liu_high_2009,yang_anomalously_2010} Further experimentation 
is suggested based on the predictions from our models, previous 
experiments,
(cite) 
and emerging broadband thermoreflectance techniques.

% by Christie et al.\cite{christie_vibrational_2007} and others.
% 
% In conclusion we have shown that in a system without any
% periodic order such as a monatomic liquid, one observes in-
% elastic excitations that can be interpreted as the noncrystal-
% line counterpart of Umklapp peaks.\cite{scopigno_observation_2001} 
% 
% The goal of this work...
% 
% In this work, we consider two ``stiff glass'' amorphous systems:
% Structural relxation phenomena do not dominate the dynamics 
% of the.\cite{gotze_evolution_2000} 
% 
% For modeling the low frequency vibrational modes, two types of 
% scattering mechanisms are considered: (a) phonon-phonon 
% scattering (b) Rayleigh scattering.

% The goal of this work is to predict the MFP of vibrational modes in 
% disordered systems. Simple Lennard-Jones systems will be studied.  A 
% perfect LJ crystal are alloyed with a species of differing mass and 
% amorphous samples are prepared. Thermal transport will be studied to

\section{\label{S:Theory}Theoretical Formulation}
%--------------------------------------------------------------------------

%--------------------------------------------------------------------------
\subsection{\label{S:Theory:Thermal}Vibrational Thermal Conductivity}
%--------------------------------------------------------------------------

We calculate the total vibrational thermal conductivity, $k_{vib}$, 
of an amorphous solids from 
\begin{equation}\label{EQ:kvib}
\begin{split}
k_{vib} = k_{pr} + k_{AF},
\end{split}
\end{equation}
where $k_{pr}$\cite{ashcroft_solid_1976,dove_introduction_1993,
ziman_electrons_2001} is the contribution from 
propagating (phonon-like) modes and $k_{AF}$ is the contribution 
from diffusons (i.e., delocalized, non-propagating modes) predicted 
by the Allen-Feldman (AF) theory.\cite{feldman_thermal_1993} 

The propagating contribution is predicted from
\cite{feldman_thermal_1993,feldman_numerical_1999}  
\begin{equation}\label{EQ:kph}
\begin{split}
k_{pr} = \frac{1}{V}\int_{0}^{\omega_{cut}} 
DOS(\omega) C(\omega) D_{pr}(\omega)d\omega,
\end{split}
\end{equation}
where $V$ is the system volume, $\omega$ is the mode 
frequency, $\omega_{cut}$ is the maximum frequency of propagating 
modes,  
$DOS(\omega)$ is the vibrational 
density of states, $C(\omega)$ is the mode specific heat, 
and $D_{pr}(\omega)$ is the mode thermal diffusivity 
(see Eq. \eqref{EQ:Dtau}).\cite{feldman_thermal_1993} 
The propagating contribution $k_{pr}$ is written as an integral 
because the required use of finite simulation sizes
\cite{feldman_thermal_1993,feldman_numerical_1999} 
limit the lowest frequency 
modes that can be studied. An extrapolation 
must be made to the zero frequency limit.
\cite{feldman_thermal_1993,cahill_thermal_1994,
baldi_thermal_2008,yang_anomalously_2010}    
Equation \eqref{EQ:kph} is obtained using the single-mode relaxation
time approximation to solve 
the Boltzmann transport equation for a phonon gas.
\cite{ziman_electrons_2001}. In the derivation of Eq. 
\eqref{EQ:kph}, the system is assumed to be isotropic 
(which is valid for an amorphous material) 
and a single polarization,(cite) making the mode 
properties only a function of frequency. The 
choice of single phonon polarization (i.e., an averaging 
of the transverse and longitudinal branches) 
does not significantly change the results predicted in this work  
or that of others.
\cite{feldman_thermal_1993,cahill_thermal_1994,
feldman_numerical_1999,baldi_thermal_2008,liu_high_2009,
yang_anomalously_2010} We write Eq. \eqref{EQ:kph} in terms of the 
mode diffusivities to align with the diffuson theory,
\cite{feldman_thermal_1993} which 
is described later in this Section. 

We will evaluate Eq. \eqref{EQ:kph} under the Debye approximation, 
which assumes isotropic and linear dispersion such that the 
the density of states is
\begin{equation}\label{EQ:DOS_debye}
DOS(\omega) = \frac{3\pi\omega^2}{2v_{s,DOS}^3},
\end{equation}
where $v_s$ is an appropriate sound speed.\cite{ashcroft_solid_1976}  
Since we use classical MD simulations,\cite{mcquarrie_statistical_2000} 
we take the specific heat to be $C(\omega) = k_{\text{B}}$ in the 
harmonic limit, where $k_{\text{B}}$ is the Boltzmann constant. 
This harmonic approximation has been shown to be valid 
for a-Si modeled using the Stillinger-Weber potential at the temperatures of 
interest here (300 K) for low-frequency modes.\cite{feldman_thermal_1993} 
Taking the classical limit for the specific heat allows for a direct 
comparison between the MD- and lattice dynamics-based 
methods in our modeling framework.

The diffusivity of the propagating modes is    
\begin{equation}\label{EQ:Dtau}
\begin{split}
D_{pr}(\omega) = \frac{1}{3}v^2_s\tau(\omega),
\end{split}
\end{equation}
where $\tau(\omega)$ is 
the mode lifetime.\cite{ziman_electrons_2001} 
An equivalent physical picture in terms of a scattering length 
is
\begin{equation}\label{EQ:DLambda}
\begin{split}
D(\omega) = \frac{1}{3}v_s \Lambda(\omega),
\end{split}
\end{equation}
where $\Lambda(\omega)$ is the phonon mean free path (MFP), defined as 
\begin{equation}\label{EQ:Lambda}
\begin{split}
\Lambda(\omega) = v_{s} \tau(\omega).
\end{split}
\end{equation}
The lifetimes will be modeled using 
\begin{equation}\label{EQ:tauw2}
\begin{split}
\tau(\omega) = B \omega^{-n}.
\end{split}
\end{equation}
For amorphous materials, the scaling exponent $n$ 
has been found experimentally and numerically to be 
between 2 and 4,
\cite{vacher_ultrasonic_1981,
feldman_thermal_1993,morath_phonon_1996,benassi_evidence_1996,
feldman_numerical_1999,taraskin_determination_1999,
taraskin_propagation_2000,gotze_evolution_2000,ruocco_relaxation_2000,
ruocco_high-frequency_2001,horbach_high_2001,
matic_sound_2001,

wyart_scaling_2010,baldi_elastic_2011,
he_heat_2011,ayrinhac_subterahertz_2011,
baldi_emergence_2013}
where $n=2$ corresponds to 
Umklapp scattering\cite{callaway_model_1959} and $n=4$ corresponds to 
Rayleigh scattering from point defects.\cite{klemens_scattering_1955}
Combined with the form of the $DOS(\omega)$ [Eq. \eqref{EQ:DOS_debye}] 
choosing $n\le2$  
ensures that the 
thermal conductivity evaluated from Eq. \eqref{EQ:kph} is finite. 
Choosing $n>2$ causes the thermal conductivity to diverge,   
which can be fixed using additional anharmonic
\cite{feldman_thermal_1993,feldman_numerical_1999} 
or boundary scattering.
\cite{cahill_thermal_1994,liu_high_2009,yang_anomalously_2010}

The AF diffuson contribution to thermal conductivity is
\cite{feldman_thermal_1993,feldman_numerical_1999}
\begin{equation}\label{EQ:kAF}
\begin{split}
k_{AF} = \frac{1}{V}\sum_{\omega_i>\omega_{cut}} C_i(\omega) D_{AF,i}(\omega), 
\end{split}
\end{equation}
where $\omega_i$ is the frequency of the $i$th diffuson mode, $C_i(\omega_i)$ 
is the diffuson specific heat, and $D_{AF,i}$ is the diffuson diffusivity.
Equation \eqref{EQ:kAF} is written as a sum because there are enough 
high-frequency 
diffuson in the finite-size systems studied here to ensure a converged 
value.\cite{feldman_thermal_1993,feldman_numerical_1999} 
% Written as an integral, Eq. \eqref{EQL:kAF} has the same form as 
% Eq. \ref{EQ:kph}, which can be derived starting 
% with the Kubo theory
% \cite{flicker_lattice_1973,allen_thermal_1993,alam_lattice_2005,
% baldi_thermal_2008,yang_anomalously_2010}  
% and taking the limit 
% of zero phonon self-energy.\cite{baldi_thermal_2008} 
The AF diffusivities are predicted by\cite{allen_thermal_1993} 
\begin{equation}\label{EQ:DAF}
\begin{split}
D_{AF,i} = \frac{\pi V^2}{\hbar^2\omega^2_i}\sum_{j\neq i}
|S_{ij}|^2 \delta(\omega_i - \omega_j),
\end{split}
\end{equation}
where $\hbar$ is Planck's constant and $\delta$ is the Dirac delta 
function. The heat current operator $S_{ij}$,
which measures the thermal coupling 
between vibrational modes $i$ and $j$ based on their frequencies and 
spatial overlap of eigenvectors, 
can be calculated from harmonic lattice dynamics theory.
\cite{allen_thermal_1993,feldman_thermal_1993,feldman_numerical_1999} 
For Eq. \eqref{EQ:DAF}, $S_{ij}$ is directionally averaged because 
the amorphous materials studied in this work are isotropic. 
The diffuson specific heat is taken to be $k_{\text{B}}$ 
to allow for the comparison between the MD- and LD-based 
methods.  

The form of Eq. \eqref{EQ:kvib} has been used in 
several previous studies of amorphous materials with varying 
assumptions.\cite{feldman_thermal_1993,cahill_thermal_1994,
baldi_thermal_2008,
liu_high_2009,yang_anomalously_2010,feldman_numerical_1999,
baldi_thermal_2008,he_heat_2011} 
The various 
assumptions all lead to predictions that $k_{pr}$ is a negligible 
($< 10\%$) 
and non-negligible ($> 20\%$) fraction of $k_{vib}$ 
for 
a-SiO2\cite{baldi_thermal_2008} and 
a-Si\cite{feldman_thermal_1993,cahill_thermal_1994,
feldman_numerical_1999,liu_high_2009,yang_anomalously_2010,
he_heat_2011}, respectively.  

(NOT HERE)
While predictions for the contributions to the total 
vibrational thermal conductivity $k_{vib}$ from 
propagating ($k_{pr}$) and non-propagating ($k_{AF}$) have 
been made for a-SiO2 and a-Si,(cite) no thermal conductivity 
accumulation functions have been predicted to compare with Regner.
(cite) 
Using lattice dynamics calculations and molecular dynamics simulations 
of large-scale ($~4000$ atom models), 
we predict the inputs to Eq. \eqref{EQ:kvib} in Sections \ref{S:DOS}, 
\ref{S:Structure}, \ref{S:Diffusivities}, and the bulk thermal 
conductivity 
$k_{vib}$ and its contributions $k_{pr}$ and $k_{AF}$ in Section 
\ref{S:Bulk} 
Using very large-scale (up to $800,000$ atoms) 
MD simulations, we predict the thermal 
thermal conductivity $k_{vib}$ of bulk a-SiO2 and a-Si to compare with 
the predictions based on the mode-by-mode properties. 
For the first time, the MFPs of propagating modes in bulk 
a-SiO2 and a-Si are used with a boundary scattering model 
to predict the thermal conductivity accumulation, which is 
compared with experimental thin film measurements and broadband 
FDTR measurements of a-SiO2 and a-Si in Section \ref{S:Accumulation}.

%--------------------------------------------------------------------------
\subsection{\label{S:Limits}Thermal Conductivity and Diffusivity Limits}
%--------------------------------------------------------------------------

To interpret the non-propagating contribution $k_{AF}$, it is useful 
to consider a high-scatter (HS) limit for the mode diffusivity,
\begin{equation}\label{EQ:D_HS}
D_{HS} = \frac{1}{3} v_s a,
\end{equation}
where it is assumed that all vibrational modes travel with the sound speed  
$v_s$ and scatter over a distance of the lattice constant $a$.
\cite{cahill_lattice_1988}  
Equation \eqref{EQ:D_HS} leads to a high-scatter (HS) limit of 
thermal conductivity in the classical limit given by
\cite{cahill_lattice_1988} 
\begin{equation}\label{EQ:k_HS}
k_{HS} = \frac{k_{\text{B}}}{V_b}b v_s a,
\end{equation}
where $V_b$ is the volume of the unit cell and $b$ is the number of atoms 
in the unit cell.  
% The advantage is that $k_{HS}$ is a simple 
% functional form of the macroscopic material properties which can 
% be evaluated with experimental measurements or modeling predictions. 
% While Eqs. \eqref{EQ:D_HS} and \eqref{EQ:k_HS} are commonly used to 
% establish a high-scatter limits for 
% diffusivity and thermal conductivity, predictions for a-SiGe alloys 
% \cite{feldman_thermal_1993} and experiments 
% demonstrate that these are not true high-scatter limits.  
Equation \eqref{EQ:k_HS} has been found to be a good lower limit 
for the thermal conductivity of a-SiO2
\cite{freeman_thermal_1986,cahill_lattice_1988,baldi_thermal_2008}, 
a-Si,\cite{feldman_thermal_1993,cahill_thermal_1994,
feldman_numerical_1999,he_heat_2011}, 
and other glasses.\cite{
kittel_interpretation_1949,
cahill_thermal_1989,
pohl_low-temperature_2002,
sosso_thermal_2012,
larkin_predicting_2013}

Kittel suggested that  
the thermal conductivity of glasses in the high-temperature limit could 
be interpreted 
using a temperature-independent high-scatter diffusivity similar to 
Eq. \eqref{EQ:D_HS}.\cite{kittel_interpretation_1949}  
Kittel's theory 
implies that the modes that dominate thermal transport in glasses are 
vibrations with MFPs $\Lambda=a$, such that   
$k_{vib} \approx k_{HS}$.
\cite{kittel_interpretation_1949,graebner_phonon_1986}  
For models of amorphous Lennard-Jones argon
\cite{larkin_predicting_2013} and 
a-GeTe\cite{sosso_thermal_2012}, $k_{vib}$ is predicted to be equal 
to $k_{HS}$ within the errors.   
For a-SiO$_2$, $k_{vib} \approx 2k_{HS}$, but it is unclear what the 
appropriate lattice constant should be, making a factor of 
two reasonable.   
For a-Si, the experimentally measured thermal conductivity at 
a temperature of 
300 K is $(1-6) k_{HS}$,
\cite{feldman_thermal_1993,cahill_thermal_1994,
feldman_numerical_1999,liu_high_2009,yang_anomalously_2010,
he_heat_2011} 
indicating that there may be a large contribution from $k_{pr}$. 

(NOT HERE)
We investigate the contributions $k_{pr}$ and $k_{AF}$ using 
detailed atomistic models for a-SiO2 and a-Si which are 
described in the next section.

\subsection{\label{S:Sample}Sample Preparation}
%--------------------------------------------------------------------------

The three smallest a-SiO$_2$ samples are the same as those used 
in Ref. \citenum{mcgaughey_thermal_2004} 
and contain 288 , 576, and 972 atoms. These samples were 
originally prepared using a melt-quench procedure. 
Using the same procedure, larger systems of 
$N_a = $ 2880, 4608, and 34,562 were created by 
tiling the smaller samples.  
The entire melt-quench procedure was performed at constant volume.
\cite{mcgaughey_thermal_2004} 
The tiled samples were first 
melted at a temperature of 10,000 K in a cubic simulation cell. 
The liquid was then quenched 
instantaneously to 300 K and annealed for 10 ns. 

The largest sample 
has 34,562 atoms and a supercell side length of 8.052 nm. 
All samples were 
simulated at a density, $\rho$, of 2350 kg/m$^3$.
\cite{mcgaughey_thermal_2004} 
The atomic interactions are modeled using 
a modified BKS potential from Ref. 
\citenum{mcgaughey_thermal_2004}, except that the 24-6 
Lennard-Jones (LJ) potential is changed to a 12-6, 
which has a negligible effect on the predictions.  
The LJ potentials use a cutoff of 8.5 $\AA$ and the Buckingham 
potential uses a cutoff of 10 $\AA$. 
The electrostatic interactions are handled using the Wolf direct 
summation method with 
exponential parameter $\eta=0.223 \AA^{-1}$ and a cutoff of 12 $\AA$.
\cite{wolf_exact_1999} 

For a-Si, we use models generated using the 
modified Wooten-Winer-Weaire (WWW) algorithm 
from Ref. \citenum{barkema_high-quality_2000}.  Sample sizes 
with 216, 1000, 4096, and 100,000 atoms. 
Similarly-large 
models of a-Si were studied in Ref. \citenum{he_heat_2011} using the 
MD-based direct method to predict thermal conductivity. 
A large sample was created from the 100,000 atom sample 
by treating it 
as a unit cell and tiling twice in all directions to create an 
800,000 atom sample with supercell side length of 24.81 nm.  
All a-Si structures have a density of 2330 kg/m$^3$, 
equivalent to the perfect 
crystal with a lattice constant of 5.43 $\AA$. 
The Stillinger-Weber potential models the atomic interactions.
\cite{stillinger_computer_1985}   

Amorphous materials may have many different atomic 
configurations with nearly equivalent potential energies 
leading to potential metastability during MD simulations.
\cite{feldman_numerical_1999,
durandurdu_<i>ab_2002,bernstein_structural_2006,he_heat_2011} 
This meta-stability can 
cause errors when predicting vibrational lifetimes using Normal 
Mode Decomposition (NMD, see Section \ref{S:Life}).(cite) 
To remove metastability, all Both a-SiO2 and a-Si samples 
were annealed at a temperature of 
1100 K for 10 ns.\cite{feldman_numerical_1999,he_heat_2011} 
The removal of meta-stability is demonstrated 
by a decrease and plateau of the sample's potential energy.  
Small samples of a-SiO2 and a-Si are shown in 
Fig. \ref{FIG:supercell}.

\subsection{\label{S:Simulation}Simulation Details}
%--------------------------------------------------------------------------

Molecular dynamics (MD) simulations are performed using the 
a-SiO$_2$ and a-Si supercells described in 
Section \ref{S:Sample}. 
The MD simulations were performed using LAMMPS\cite{plimpton_fast_1995}  
with time steps of dt = 0.905(0.5) fs for a-SiO$_2$(a-Si). 
Ten MD simulations with different initial conditions were run and 
the predictions from these simulations were ensemble averaged. 
All MD simulations are first equilibrated in an $NVT$ (constant number 
of atoms, volume, and temperature) ensemble for $10^6$ 
time steps. Data are then collected from simulations
in the $NVE$ (constant number of atoms, volume, and total
energy) ensemble 
for $2^{21}$ time steps where the atomic trajectories are sampled 
every $2^{8}$ time steps. 

The Green-Kubo (GK) method is used to predict a top-down thermal 
conductivity $k_{GK}$ (i.e., without using Eq. \eqref{EQ:kvib}). 
The $k_{GK}$ is predicted by window averaging the integral of 
The first-avalanche method is used to predict $k_{GK}$.
\cite{chen_how_2010} 
For system sizes of 4,608(4,096) atoms, the trajectories from 
the MD simulations used for the GK prediction method are 
also used with the NMD method to predict 
the vibrational mode lifetimes for a-SiO2(a-Si) for use in 
Eq. \eqref{EQ:kvib} (Section \ref{S:Life}). 

For the amorphous supercells studied,
the only allowed wave vector is the gamma-point (i.e., $\pmb{\kappa}=0$),  
where $\pmb{\kappa}$ is the wavevector and there are $3N_a$ polarization 
branches labeled by $\nu$. 
Calculation of the 
vibrational modes at the Gamma point  
requires the eigenvalue solution 
of a dynamical matrix of size 
$(3N_a)^2$ that scales as $[(3N_a)^2]^3$, limiting the system 
sizes that can be considered to 4,608(4,096) atoms for 
a-SiO$_2$(a-Si). 
The eigenvalue solution is required to predict the vibrational 
DOS (Section \ref{S:DOS}) and structure factors 
(Section \ref{S:Structure}), and to perform the NMD technique  
(see Section \ref{S:Life})  
and AF calculations (see Section \ref{S:Diffusivities}). 
The frequencies and eigenvectors were computed using harmonic
lattice dynamics calculations and GULP.\cite{gale_general_2003} 
The calculation of the AF thermal diffusivities 
[Eq. \eqref{EQ:DAF}] 
is performed using GULP and a Lorentzian 
broadening of $14\delta\omega_{avg}$($5\delta\omega_{avg}$) for 
a-SiO$_2$(a-Si), where $\delta\omega_{avg}$ is the average mode 
frequency spacing [$\delta\omega_{avg} = ()$ for a-SiO2(a-Si)].
\cite{feldman_thermal_1993,feldman_numerical_1999} 
For a-Si the broadening used here is within 
$20\%$ of that used 
in Ref \citenum{feldman_numerical_1999}. 
Varying the broadening around these values does not 
change the resulting thermal conductivity $k_{AF}$ significantly 
(see Section \ref{S:Bulk}).

\section{\label{S:Vibrational}Vibrational Properties}
%--------------------------------------------------------------------------

%--------------------------------------------------------------------------
\subsection{\label{S:DOS}Density of States}
%--------------------------------------------------------------------------

In this section, we examine the vibrational frequencies and 
DOS for a-SiO$_2$ and a-Si. 
The vibrational DOS is computed from  
\begin{equation}\label{EQ:DOS}
DOS(\omega) = \sum_i \delta(\omega_i - \omega),
\end{equation}
where a unit step function of width $100\delta\omega_{avg}$ 
is used to broaden $\delta(\omega_i - \omega)$.   
Results are plotted in Fig. \ref{FIG:DOS} 
using a broadening of $10\delta\omega_{avg}$ and .  
Because of the finite model size, the low-frequency modes are sparse and 
the DOS can depend on the broadening.
This broadening is large enough 
to obtain a smooth DOS but small enough to capture the 
low frequency behavior.\cite{feldman_numerical_1999}  

The DOS for a-Si is similar to the 
DOS of crystalline silicon,
\cite{williams_numerical_1985,donadio_atomistic_2009} with 
pronounced features at mid- and high-frequencies. The DOS for 
a-SiO$_2$ is constant over most of the frequency-range, 
with a gap at the higher frequencies that separates the Si-O
interactions.\cite{mcgaughey_thermal_2004} 
There is a clear $\omega^{-2}$ scaling for both 
a-Si and a-SiO$_2$ at the lowest frequencies. 
The onset of this scaling occurs at a higher frequency 
for a-Si than a-SiO$_2$. This low-frequency scaling is predicted 
by the Debye model [Eq. \eqref{EQ:DOS_debye}] 
and suggests that these modes may be 
propagating (i.e., phonon-like). 

% The observation that the acoustic modes are located on
% top of a flat background for intermediate values of q has re-

\subsection{\label{S:Structure}Structure Factor}
%--------------------------------------------------------------------------

Calculating the structure factors of the supercell Gamma   
modes is a method to test for their propagating (plane-wave)  
character at a particular wave vector and 
polarization 
and has been previously used to predict effective 
dispersion curves of amorphous materials 
experimentally\cite{kaya_normal_2010,green_density_2011}(more)  
and 
numerically.
\cite{biswas_vibrational_1988,feldman_thermal_1993,
allen_diffusons_1999,feldman_numerical_1999,
taraskin_determination_1999,taraskin_propagation_2000,

wyart_scaling_2010,
beltukov_ioffe-regel_2013,larkin_predicting_2013,
marruzzo_heterogeneous_2013} 
The structure factor at a wave vector 
$\pmb{\kappa}$ is defined as\cite{allen_diffusons_1999} 
\begin{equation}\label{EQ:SLT}
S^{L,T}\kw = 
\sum_{\nu} E^{L,T}\kv
\delta (\omega-\omega\kgv),
\end{equation}
where the summation is over the Gamma modes, $E^{T}$ refers 
to the transverse polarization and is defined as
\begin{equation}\label{EQ:EL}
E^L\kv = 
\left|
\sum_{b} 
\hat{\pmb{\kappa}} \cdot e\kgvba 
\EXP{i\pmb{\kappa}\cdot\pmb{r}_0\ab{l=0}{b}} 
\right|^2
\end{equation}
and $E^{L}$ refers to the longitudinal polarization and is defined as
\begin{equation}\label{EQ:ET}
E^T\kv = 
\left|
\sum_{b} 
\hat{\pmb{\kappa}} \times e\kgvba 
\EXP{i\pmb{\kappa}\cdot\pmb{r}_0\ab{l=0}{b}} 
\right|^2.
\end{equation}
In Eqs. \eqref{EQ:EL} and \eqref{EQ:ET}, the $b$ summations are 
over the atoms in the disordered supercell, 
$\pmb{r}_0\ab{l=0}{b}$ refers to the equilibrium atomic position of 
atom $b$, $l$ labels the unit cells 
($l=0$ for the supercell), 
$\alpha$ labels the Cartesian coordinates, and 
$\hat{\pmb{\kappa}}$ is a unit vector.  
The vibrational mode shape is contained in the 
$3N_a$ components of its eigenvector, $e\kgvba$.(cite)

The transverse and longitudinal structure factors 
$S^{L,T}\knw$ are plotted in Figs. 
\ref{FIG:disp}(a) and \ref{FIG:disp}(b) for 
a-SiO$_2$ and a-Si for wavevectors along the 
[100] direction of the 
supercells. Because amorphous structures are isotropic, 
the structure factors are direction-independent. 
The wavenumbers are normalized by $2\pi/a$, where $a$ 
is 4.8(5.43) $\AA$ for a-SiO$_2$(a-Si), which is based 
on the lattice constants of c-SiO2(c-Si).
\cite{stillinger_computer_1985,mcgaughey_thermal_2004} 

Mode frequencies [$\omega_0(\kappa)$] and linewidths 
[$\Gamma(\kappa)$] can be 
predicted by fitting each structure 
factor peak $S^{L,T}\knw$ to a Lorentzian function
\begin{equation}\label{EQ:Lorentzian_SLT}
\begin{split}
S^{L,T}\knw = 
\frac{C_0(\pmb{\kappa})}{[\omega_0(\pmb{\kappa})-\omega]^2+
\Gamma^2(\pmb{\kappa})},
\end{split}
\end{equation}
where $C_0(\nu)$ is a constant related to the DOS.
\cite{beltukov_ioffe-regel_2013} A dispersion relation is identified by 
plotting $\omega_0(\kappa)$ values in the middle panels of 
Figs. \ref{FIG:disp}(a) and \ref{FIG:disp}(b), 
where the error bars 
indicate the linewidths. 

For a-Si, the peaks are reasonably Lorentzian for all wavenumbers.
\cite{feldman_calculations_2002} 
For a-SiO2, the peaks are well-approximated as Lorentzian only at the 
smallest wavenumbers. For 
large wavenumber, the structure factors peaks are less than an order 
of magnitude larger than the background, and the widths are on the order 
of the total frequency range.

For a-Si, the extracted dispersion is 
nearly linear at small wavenumbers with a slight 
decrease in slope at the largest values.
\cite{feldman_thermal_1993,feldman_numerical_1999} 
For a-SiO2, the dispersion is concave-down for 
the smallest wavenumbers considered, transitioning to a strong 
concave-up dispersion at intermediate wavenumbers. 
For the intermediate wavenumbers, 
the longitudinal dispersion for a-SiO$_2$ 
is well-described by the so-called 
''dispersion law for diffusons``, where $\omega \propto \kappa^2$.
\cite{beltukov_ioffe-regel_2013} This large concave-up dispersion has been 
observed in various amorphous models
\cite{feldman_calculations_2002,ruzicka_evidence_2004,baldi_thermal_2008} 
including a-SiO2.\cite{ruzicka_evidence_2004,baldi_thermal_2008} 
We note that at frequencies lower than $100$ GHz, experimental measurements 
of a-SiO2 recover a linear dispersion.

\subsection{\label{S:Vg}Group Velocity}
%--------------------------------------------------------------------------

For a disordered solid, 
except for the transverse and longitudinal sound speeds, there is not an 
accepted method to predict the group velocity of each  
vibrational mode. 
While the structure factor gives the frequency spectrum needed to 
construct a propagating state with pure wavevector $\pmb{\kappa}$, 
the mode spectra $E^{T}\kv$ and $E^{L}\kv$ predict the plane-wave 
character of each mode. It is not generally possible 
to assign a unique wavevector to individual modes, even at low frequency,
\cite{biswas_vibrational_1988,feldman_thermal_1993,silbert_normal_2009} 
which makes predicting individual mode group velocities challenging. 
Attempts have been made to predict individual mode group velocities,
\cite{duda_reducing_2011,donadio_atomistic_2009,
he_heat_2011,he_thermal_2011,hori_phonon_2013} 
but there is no theoretical basis for these methods. 
% In the Cahill-Pohl (CP) model, for example, the group velocity of 
% all disordered modes is the sound speed, $v_s$, which is also assumed  
% for the HS model Eq. \eqref{EQ:M:k_AF,HS}.
% \cite{cahill_lattice_1988} This assumption is not generally valid  
% for any material.\cite{feldman_numerical_1999,duda_reducing_2011,
% donadio_atomistic_2009,he_heat_2011,he_thermal_2011,larkin_predicting_2013}
% To treat this problem, we focus on the mode thermal diffusivities 
% and compare predictions from the 
% NMD method (Section \ref{S:Life}) and AF theory in 
% Section \ref{S:Diffusivities}.

We now use the DOS and structure factors predicted in 
Sections \ref{S:DOS} and \ref{S:Structure} to 
predict the group velocity of the low-frequency modes for 
a-SiO2 and a-Si. By fitting the DOS 
from Fig. \ref{FIG:DOS} to Eq. \eqref{EQ:DOS_debye}, 
a sound speed $v_{s,DOS}$ is obtained and is  
reported in Table \ref{T:vs}. Because the DOS is a mixture of 
transverse and longitudinal modes, only a single sound speed can be 
predicted. 
Both longitudinal and transverse sound speeds can be predicted from 
the structure factor peaks by finite 
differencing the equation 
\begin{equation}\label{EQ:vs_dwdk}
v_{s} = \frac{ \delta \omega_0(\kappa)}{\delta \kappa}.
\end{equation}
The results for the lowest frequencis are provided in Table \ref{T:vs}. 
The transverse and longitudinal sound speeds of a material can 
also be predicted from the material's bulk ($G$) and 
shear ($K$) moduli from 
\begin{equation}\label{EQ:vs_T_elas}
v_{s,T} = \frac{G}{\rho}^{1/2},
\end{equation}
and 
\begin{equation}\label{EQ:vs_L_elas}
v_{s,L} = \frac{4G + 3K}{3\rho}^{1/2}.
\end{equation}
We use the bulk and shear moduli defined in terms of the elastic 
constants according to the Voight convention.\cite{gale_general_2003}  
The corresponding sound speeds are reported in Table \ref{T:vs}. 
The longitudinal and transverse sound speeds predicted for a-Si are 
in good agreement with those found in a previous study using a similar 
model.\cite{feldman_thermal_1993,feldman_numerical_1999} 
Comment about a-SiO2 sound speeds with expt and modeling.(cite)

By comparing the sound speeds in Table \ref{T:vs}, it is clear that 
the DOS of our models for a-Si and a-SiO$_2$ are characterized by using the 
transverse sound speeds.  
The transverse sound speeds obtained from the 
elastic moduli are larger than those from the structure factors, 
which results from the concave-down dispersion seen at low 
$\kappa$, particularly for a-SiO2 (Fig. ).(cite) 
For a-SiO2, the concave-down dispersion
also affects the low-frequency DOS, where the predicted sound speed 
$v_{s,DOS}$ is less than that predicted from the structure factor 
and the elastic constants. The concave-down dispersion 
is less pronounced for a-Si, where the sound speeds predicted 
by all three methods are within five percent of each other. 

Under the Debye model (Eq. \eqref{EQ:DOS_debye}), 
the $\emph{smaller}$ transverse sound speed 
makes the $\emph{larger}$ contribution to the DOS which scales 
as the sound speed cubed. For a-Si and a-SiO2  
the contribution from longitudinal modes to the Debye DOS is nearly 
an order of magnitude less than the transverse modes for a given 
frequency interval. For a-SiO$_2$, the longitudinal and 
transverse sound speeds are closer, but the non-linear dispersion 
is stronger than a-Si (Fig. \ref{FIG:disp}).(cite) 
The intensity of the structure factors, which   
are directly proportional to the DOS,
\cite{beltukov_ioffe-regel_2013} for transverse polaritzations was found 
to be four to five\cite{taraskin_phonons_1997} 
and six to eight\cite{horbach_high_2001} times larger than longitudinal 
polarizations for models 
of a-SiO2, which supports our finding that the DOS is dominated 
by transverse modes. 
The transverse sound speed predicted by the DOS, $v_{s,DOS}$, is used for both 
a-SiO$_2$ and a-Si throughout the rest of this work and is discussed 
in Section \ref{S:Bulk}.

\subsection{\label{S:Life}Lifetimes}
%--------------------------------------------------------------------------

We now predict the lifetimes of all vibrational modes in our 
models of a-SiO2 and a-Si using the MD simulation-based NMD method.
\cite{ladd_lattice_1986,mcgaughey_quantitative_2004,henry_spectral_2008,
turney_predicting_2009-1,
he_heat_2011,larkin_comparison_2012,hori_phonon_2013} 
The NMD-predicted lifetimes will be 
compared with the timescales extracted from the structure 
factor linewidths, $\tau_{SF} = 1/2\Gamma(\kappa)$ 
(Section \ref{S:Structure}, (Eq. \eqref{EQ:Lorentzian_SLT})). 
The NMD method explicitly includes the disorder in the supercell.
\cite{he_heat_2011,he_thermal_2011,he_morphology_2011,he_lattice_2012,
larkin_predicting_2013}

In NMD, the 
atomic trajectories from MD simulations are first mapped onto the vibrational 
mode coordinate time derivative,
\cite{dove_introduction_1993}
\begin{equation}\label{EQ:qdot}
\begin{split}
\dot{q}\kgvt{}{}{}=&\SUM{0}{}\sqrt{\frac{m_b}{N}}\dot{u}_{\alpha}
\lbt e^*\kgvba\EXP{i(\pmb{0}\cdot\mathbf{r}_0\ab{l}{0}}.
\end{split}
\end{equation}
Here, $m_b$ is the mass of the $b_{th}$ atom in the supercell, 
$u_{\alpha}$ is the $\alpha$-component of the atomic displacement 
from equilibrium, $\dot{u}_{\alpha}$ is the $\alpha$-component 
of the atomic velocity, and $t$ is time. Because the supercells 
of a-SiO2 and a-Si are disordered, the NMD method is performed at 
the wavevector $\pmb{\kappa} = \pmb{0}$. 
The spectral energy of each vibrational mode, $\Phi\kvt$, is calculated 
from 
\begin{equation}\label{A:E:Phi_NMD}
\begin{split}
\Phi(\nu,\omega) = 
\lim_{\tau_0\rightarrow\infty}\frac{1}{2\tau_0}
\left|\frac{1}{\sqrt{2\pi}}\int_{0}^{\tau_0}\dot{q}\kgvt
\exp(-i\omega t)dt\right|^2.
\end{split}
\end{equation}
We choose the frequency domain representation of the normal mode 
energy because it is less sensitive to metastability 
of the amorphous structure.

The vibrational mode frequency and lifetime are predicted by fitting each mode's 
spectral energy $\Phi(\nu,\omega)$ to a Lorentzian function, 
\begin{equation}\label{EQ:Lorentzian_NMD}
\begin{split}
\Phi(\nu,\omega) = 
\frac{C_0(\nu)}{[\omega_0(\nu)-\omega]^2+\Gamma^2(\nu)},
\end{split}
\end{equation}
where the constant $C_0(\nu)$ is related to the average mode energy of 
each mode and the linewidth $\Gamma(\nu)$ and is valid when 
$\Gamma(\nu) << \omega_0(\nu)$.\cite{larkin_comparison_2012} 
The mode lifetime is\cite{ladd_lattice_1986,turney_predicting_2009-1} 
\begin{equation}\label{EQ:NMD_life}
\begin{split}
\tau(\nu) = \frac{1}{2\Gamma(\nu)}.
\end{split}
\end{equation}

The NMD-predicted lifetimes are plotted in Fig. \ref{FIG:Lifetimes} 
for a-SiO2 and a-Si. 
For a-SiO2, the mode lifetimes are generally larger than 
the Ioffe-Regel (IR) limit $\tau = 2\pi/\omega$,
\cite{taraskin_determination_1999} and follow 
this limit at low frequency. There is no clear evidence for an 
$\omega^{-2}$ scaling, which corresponds to propagating modes.  
At mid frequencies the mode lifetimes are constant. 
There is a peak near 2 $\times 10^{14}$ rads$/$s which corresponds to 
a peak in the DOS (see Fig. \ref{FIG:DOS}). 
The lifetimes predicted from the 
structure factor fall below the NMD-predicted lifetimes 
and the IR limit. These low values result because the structure factor for 
a-SiO2 is evaluated for wavenumbers where the 
peaks are not well-approximated as Lorentzian.
(cite) 
Furthermore, the linewidths (the inverse of the lifetime) are 
on the order of the frequencies. 
Previous modeling and theoretical predictions show that the 
structure factor begins to take on the form of the DOS 
for large enough wavenumber,
\cite{martin-mayor_dynamical_2001,baldi_thermal_2008} and that the 
linewidths (timescales) are not meaningful.

For a-Si, the mode lifetimes show a clear $\omega^{-2}$ 
scaling at low frequency. 
The lifetimes plateau at higher frequencies,
over a wider range of frequencies than a-SiO2, with two peaks 
corresponding to peaks in the DOS (Fig. \ref{FIG:DOS}). A similar 
plateau of lifetimes at high frequencies has been 
reported for disordered lattices
\cite{sheng_heat_1991,larkin_predicting_2013} and 
other models of a-Si.\cite{he_heat_2011} 
The transition from the low-frequency scaling to 
the plateau region occurs near 
$10^{14}$ rads$/$s, which corresponds to where the DOS peaks in Fig. 
\ref{FIG:DOS}. 
Similar behavior has been observed for models of disordered lattices.
\cite{larkin_predicting_2013} The lifetimes predicted by the 
structure factor are in good agreement with those predicted by NMD 
at low frequencies. Similar agreement has been reported in other 
models of amorphous materials.
\cite{mazzacurati_low-frequency_1996} 

The NMD-predicted lifetimes in this work are similar in magnitude to 
those predicted for previous models of a-Si.
\cite{bickham_calculation_1998,fabian_anharmonic_1996,
bickham_numerical_1999,fabian_numerical_2003} 
Fabian and Allen find lifetimes on the order of picoseconds for a-Si
\cite{fabian_anharmonic_1996} and para-crystalline silicon.
\cite{fabian_numerical_2003} 
A previous study of a-Si modeled using the Tersoff potential 
predicted vibrational lifetimes on 
the order of 100 ps, an order of magnitude larger than the values 
reported here and in previous studies.
\cite{bickham_calculation_1998,fabian_anharmonic_1996,
bickham_numerical_1999,fabian_numerical_2003} 
It is unclear what the source of this 
discrepancy is, although in Ref \citenum{he_thermal_2011} 
the NMD analysis was performed in the time domain where metastability 
can be more strongly pronounced. Using the Tersoff potential on the 
WWW a-Si models in this work we predict similar lifetimes to the 
SW potential. 
Predicted lifetimes are also similar for 
samples created using a melt-quench technique 
(see Section \ref{S:Sample}).

\subsection{\label{S:Diffusivities}Diffusivities}
%--------------------------------------------------------------------------

Using the sound speeds predicted 
from the DOS $v_{s,DOS}$ (Table \ref{T:vs}), the NMD-predicted lifetimes 
for a-SiO2 and a-Si are used to predict the mode diffusivities with 
Eq. \eqref{EQ:Dtau} and are plotted in Fig. \ref{FIG:diffusivities}. 
We note that the sound speed is most appropriate  
for the lowest-frequency modes where the DOS scales as $\omega^2$ 
(Fig. \ref{FIG:DOS}). To compare with 
the NMD predictions, the AF theory is also used to predict the mode 
diffusivities which are also plotted in Fig. \ref{FIG:diffusivities}. 

For a-SiO2, the mode diffusivities predicted by NMD and AF agree 
well over the majority of the frequency range. At high frequencies the 
diffusivities do not vary much, except for a 
peak for the NMD predictions near 2 $\times 10^{14}$ rads/s which 
corresponds to the same peak in lifetimes (Fig. ). For 
the AF predictions, the mode diffusivities near 
2 $10^{14}$ rads/s and at the highest frequencies 
show a sharp decrease, which is an indication 
that these modes are localized.\cite{feldman_thermal_1993} In the 
mid-frequency range, the mode diffusivities are larger than the 
high-scatter limit [Eq. \eqref{EQ:D_HS}].

For a-SiO2 at the lowest frequencies, the 
diffusivities scale roughly as $\omega^{-2}$.  
This 
scaling is not definitive, however, for the diffusivities predicted by either 
method, particularly for the NMD predictions. 
Because there is no clear transition from propagating 
to non-propagating modes, we choose $\omega_{cut} = 4.55\times10^{12}$ rad$/$s 
for Eq. \eqref{EQ:kvib}  
based on Ref \citenum{baldi_thermal_2008} where the lowest frequency was limited 
by the experimental technique. 
This choice is discussed in Section \ref{S:Bulk}. The constant 
$B$ in Eq. \eqref{EQ:tauw2} 
is fit to the AF-predicted diffusivities for 
$\omega \le \omega_{cut}$.

For a-Si the mode diffusivities predicted by NMD and AF 
low frequencies show a clear $\omega^{-2}$ scaling. 
The NMD-predicted diffusivities are larger and show less 
scatter than those predicted by the AF theory, which is due to 
the finite-size system and the broadening which is required to evaluate 
Eq. \eqref{EQ:DAF}.\cite{feldman_thermal_1993} By using a larger 
broadening ($100\delta\omega_{avg}$) the scatter in the AF-predicted 
diffusivities at low frequency can be smoothed, but at the cost of 
decreasing the diffusivities at intermediate and high frequencies which 
affects the predicted diffuson contribution to thermal conductivity 
$k{AF}$ (see Section \ref{S:Bulk}). 
It is possible that a frequency-dependent broadening may be necessary 
for a-Si and the AF theory,  
but determining this dependence is not necessary for 
interpreting our results. The NMD- and AF-predicted diffusivities diverge 
near $10^{13}$ rads$/$s indicating that the sound speed is no longer 
applicable. The diffusivities are 
larger than the high-scatter limit [Eq. \eqref{EQ:D_HS}] except for the 
highest frequencies which are localized.\cite{feldman_thermal_1993} 

For a-Si, we choose $\omega_{cut}$  
and $B$ so that Eq. \eqref{EQ:Dtau} is equal 
to the AF-predicted diffusivity at $\omega=\omega_{cut}$. The resulting values are 
$\omega_{cut}=1.16 10^13$ rads$/$s and $B=2.76\times10^{14}$ $s^{-1}$. This choice 
allows Eq. \eqref{EQ:Dtau} to pass reasonably well through both the AF and NMD-predicted 
diffusivities. For a-Si, we also consider a separate scaling 
for Eq. \eqref{EQ:tauw2} with $n=4$ that is discussed in 
Section \ref{S:Bulk}. 
Because this scaling is not clear from the data in Fig. \ref{FIG:diffusivities} 
we use $\omega_{cut} = $ 1.52 $\times 10^{13}$ rads$/$s  
from Refs. \cite{feldman_thermal_1993} and \cite{cahill_thermal_1994} 
and choose $B$ so that Eq. \eqref{EQ:Dtau} is equal to the AF-predicted 
diffusivity at $\omega_{cut}$. We discuss these choices in 
Section \ref{S:Bulk}. 

Both a-SiO$_2$ and a-Si have a region at higher frequencies where the 
AF-predicted mode diffusivities are relatively constant. This behavior 
has been reported for a number of model disordered systems such as 
disordered lattices
\cite{sheng_heat_1991,beltukov_ioffe-regel_2013,larkin_predicting_2013}, 
amorphous solids,\cite{he_thermal_2011} 
and jammed systems.\cite{xu_energy_2009,vitelli_heat_2010}  
For a-Si the NMD- and AF-predicted diffusivities diverge 
near $10^{13}$ rads$/$s, while the NMD-predicted lifetimes 
are relatively constant above this frequency.  

While diffusons are non-propagating modes whose MFPs are not 
well-defined, a diffuson length scale can be defined as
\begin{equation}\label{EQ:LambdaAF}
\begin{split}
\Lambda_{AF,i}(\omega) = [3D_{AF,i}(\omega)\tau_{i}(\omega)]^{1/2},
\end{split}
\end{equation}
where $\tau_{i}(\omega)$ are the NMD-predicted lifetimes. Using this 
definition, $\Lambda_{AF,i}(\omega)$ is found to vary 
for both a-SiO2 and a-Si between 
the supercell size and the lattice constant 
for modes with $\omega > \omega_{cut}$. 
Similar MFPs have been estimated for diffusons in a-Si in 
previous studies.\cite{feldman_thermal_1993,feldman_numerical_1999} 
This result is in contrast to the MFPs estimated in 
Ref \citenum{he_heat_2011}
which were found to be nearly two orders of magnitude larger than the 
system size. We believe that the origin of these large MFPs 
is a combination of the predicted lifetimes (see Section \ref{S:Life}) 
and the method used to estimate the mode group velocities.
\cite{he_heat_2011}

% This implies 
% that the velocity scale for diffusons,
% \begin{equation}\label{EQ:vAF}
% \begin{split}
% v_{AF}(\omega) = \left(3\frac{D_{AF,i}(\omega)}{\tau(\omega)}\right)^{1/2},
% \end{split}
% \end{equation}
% is a function of frequency. At low frequencies, $v_{AF}$ 
% reaches as high as $v_{s,DOS}$ and decreases to about $(1/3) v_{s,DOS}$ 
% at higher frequencies. This variation of $v_{AF}(\omega)$ is similar 
% to the variation of the group velocity which can be estimated from 
% the dispersion relation found in Fig. . For a-SiO2, $v_{AF}$ is near 
% $v_{s,DOS}$ over the whole frequency range, which is the assumption 
% made for the high-scatter limit Eq. .
% 
% (WORK)
% 
% The dependence of $v_{AF}$ with frequency for a-Si is similar to 
% that found for 
% simple crystalline systems, where negative dispersion typically 
% causes a decrease of group velocity with increasing frequency (or 
% wavevector).(cite) Negative dispersion has been predicted by many 
% models of both a-SiO2 and a-Si,\cite{ruocco_relaxation_2000} 
% as have experimental measurement of 
% dispersion relations.(cite) The effective group velocities 
% which have been predicted using dispersion relations near zero 
% wavevector for large supercells of amorphous\cite{he_thermal_2011,he_heat_2011} 
% and disordered lattices\cite{hori_phonon_2013} would appear to 
% be underestimates 
% compared with the effective velocities $v_{AF}$ predicted in this work, 
% where $v_{AF}$ is within a factor of three of $v_s$ for all but the 
% highest frequency, localized modes.(cite) Our predictions for 
% $v_{AF}$ also support the notion of a minimum thermal diffusivity 
% on the order of $D_{HS}$ for all vibrational modes except   
% those which are localized (the so-called ''locons'').(cite) 

% To predict $k_{vib}$ we choose $\omega_{cut}$, 
% the constant $B$ for the diffusivity scaling, and the sound speed 
% $v_{s}$. For both a-SiO2 and a-Si, we use the sound speeds predicted 
% by a fit to the low-frequency DOS (Fig. \ref{FIG:DOS}). 
% For a-Si, the constant $B$ for the quadratic scaling is chosen such 
% that $D(\omega) = D_{AF,i}$ for $\omega_i=1.16$ rad$/$s. This value 
% of $\omega_{cut}$ is somewhat smaller than that used in Ref and . 
% The constant $B$ we find is somewhat larger than that found in 
% Ref. and . We choose this $\omega$ because of the reasonable agreement 
% between the AF-predicted $D_{AF}$ and NMD-predicted $D_{NMD}$ in this 
% frequency region, shown in Fig. \ref{FIG:diffusivities}. 
% 
% For a-Si a quadratic scaling is also 
% considered using $\omega_{cut}$ from the study by . As there is no clear 
% evidence of a quartic scaling of diffusivity, we choose the constant 
% $B$ to pass visibly through both $D_{AF}$ and $D_{NMD}$ in 
% Fig. \ref{FIG:diffusivities} because there is no clear procedure 
% to perform a fit. Our choice of $B=9.0 10^{46}$ m$^@$/s (rads$/$s)^4 
% for the quartic scaling is nearly the same as a fit\cite{cahill_lower_1994} 
% to the diffusivities in Ref \citenum{feldman_thermal_1993}, 
% $B=1.23 10^{47}$ m$^@$/s (rads$/$s)^4. 
% When using the quartic diffusivity scaling $D(\omega)\propto\omega^{-4}$, 
% the thermal conductivity is divergent as the frequency goes to zero.
% (cite) The thermal conductivity can be made finite using a boundary 
% scattering models,(cite) such as the simple one considered in 
% Section \ref{S:Bulk}. 
% While a fit to our model is not possible for the quartic scaling, 
% it has been used to explain previous experimental measurements of 
% a-Si thin films.(cite)
% 
% Baldi et al used a $\omega_{cut}=$ $4.55$ rads$/$s, which is a 
% reasonable 
% cut-off for our model of a-Si.\cite{baldi_thermal_2008} 
% Baldi et al find that the contribution $k_{ph}~0.1$ W/m-K, which is 
% the same as the contribution $k_{ph}$ predicted in this work for 
% a-SiO2. This contribution 
% $k_{ph}$ is smaller than the error bars in the predictions of $k_{vib}$ 
% and $k_{GK}$ shown in Figs. and .  
% 
% The quadratic scaling of mode diffusivities at low frequencies 
% for a-Si 
% is responsible for the system size dependent thermal conductivity 
% predicted by the GK method $k_{GK}$. 
% While our model is best described by 
% quadratic scaling, we are modeling bulk a-Si. 

% Based on the NMD-predicted diffusivities, the modes at low frequency are 
% dominated by transverse modes. However, given the scatter in the 
% NMD-predicted lifetimes, there is some mixture of 
% transverse and longitudinal 
% modes at low frequency.  Treating these two branches separately 
% is not necessary since similar results are obtained by assuming a single 
% branch scaling $D(\omega)=B\omega^{-2}$ which is fit to coincide with the 
% peak in diffusivity $D_{AF}$ at $\omega_{cut} = $ 11.6 E 12 rads/s. This 
% choice of $\omega_{cut}$ is close to that used by 
% FAB ($\omega_{cut}$ = 9.65 E 12 rads/s),\cite{feldman_thermal_1993} 
% and is somewhat smaller than 
% that used by FKAW\cite{feldman_numerical_1999} 
% and Cahill et al.\cite{cahill_thermal_1994} 
% ($\omega_{cut}$ = 15.2 E 12 rads/s). 


% It was shown that the diffusivity $D_{AF}(\omega) \propto DOS(\omega)$ 
% at low frequency when the modes are spatially uncorrelated and the 
% overlap between them is small and independent of the frequency.
% \cite{vitelli_heat_2010,xu_energy_2009} This result helps to explain 
% the plateau of diffusivity for both a-SiO2 and a-Si at higher 
% frequencies. The features in $D_{AF,i}$ for both a-SiO2 and a-Si can 
% be explained by peaks in the DOS at these frequencies.

\section{\label{S:Conductivity}Thermal Conductivity}
%--------------------------------------------------------------------------

%--------------------------------------------------------------------------
\subsection{\label{S:Bulk}Bulk}
%--------------------------------------------------------------------------

To predict the bulk thermal conductivity for our models of a-SiO2 and 
a-Si, we use Eq. \eqref{EQ:kvib} 
and the GK method. The GK method is computationally 
inexpensive compared to the NMD and AF methods so that 
larger system sizes can be studied (see Section \ref{S:Sample}).  
The GK-predicted thermal conductivities for a-SiO2 and a-Si 
are plotted in Fig. \ref{FIG:cond} for 
varying system sizes. For a-SiO2, there is no system-size dependence, 
and the bulk thermal conductivity is estimated to be 
$2.10 \pm 0.20$ W/m-K by averaging over all the predicted $k_{GK}$. 
This value is larger than experimental measurements, which range between 
1.3\cite{cahill_lattice_1988,lee_heat_1997} 
and 1.5 W/m-K,\cite{yamane_measurement_2002,regner_broadband_2013} 
because of the classical 
nature of the MD simulation (see Section \ref{S:Theory:Thermal}). 
Quantum statistical effects are considered later in this section. 

For a-Si, there is a clear system-size dependence. 
Because the low-frequency DOS has the form of Eq. \eqref{EQ:DOS_debye} 
and the diffusivities scale as $\omega^{-2}$ 
the thermal conductivity will scale as the inverse of the system size. 
The bulk value can be found by extrapolating in an infinte system size.
\cite{shiomi_thermal_2011,esfarjani_heat_2011,larkin_comparison_2012} 
The extrapolation is performed using the three largest 
system sizes, including the tiled 800,000 atom sample.  
We do not observe that tiling an a-Si model increases 
the thermal conductivity above the expected linear scaling as 
was found in Ref. \citenum{he_thermal_2011} using the MD-based 
direct method. This finding is likely due to the 
small model used to perform the tiling in that study (512 atoms),  
while we use a large model (100,000 atoms). 
The extrapolated bulk value is $1.97 \pm 0.15$ W/m-K.

To predict thermal conductivity from Eq. \eqref{EQ:kvib} 
we use the parameters $B$ and $\omega_{cut}$ specified 
in Section \ref{S:Diffusivities} assuming an $\omega^{-2}$ 
scaling below $\omega_{cut}$, and the AF-predicted diffusivities 
obtained in Section \ref{S:Diffusivities}. 
For a-SiO2, the propagating, diffuson, and total thermal 
conductivities are 0.09, 1.92, and 2.01 W/m-K. The total 
value agrees with the GK value within the errors. 
Baldi et al. estimated $0.1$ W/m-K for the propagating component,
\cite{baldi_thermal_2008} while Love and Anderson estimate 0.03 
W/m-K.\cite{love_estimate_1990} 
Shenogin et al. predicted the total thermal 
conductivity of a-SiO2 using 
non-equilibrium MD simulations of the same small structures 
used in this work, where 2.0 W/m-K was predicted for the 
largest system (972 atoms), in good agreement with the total 
bulk value predicted in this work.\cite{shenogin_predicting_2009} 
We consider the propagating contribution 
predicted in this work to be an upper-bound considering 
the lack of definitive scaling of the diffusivities 
(Fig \ref{FIG:diffusivities} and the 
strong non-linear dispersion Fig. \ref{FIG:disp}.(footnote) 
Within the errors of the predictions, $k_{pr}$ is not a significant 
fraction of $k_{vib}$ for a-SiO2. 



(footnote)
The transverse sound speed predicted for our model of 
a-SiO2 is about $85\%$ of that predicted by 
the other methods used in the present study and that 
measured by experiment.\cite{liu_high_2009}  
While using a smaller transverse sound speed 
leads to an underprediction of the 
mode diffusivity scaling (Eq. \eqref{EQ:Dtau},
Fig. \ref{FIG:diffusivities} ), it leads to an 
overprediction of the DOS (Eq. \eqref{EQ:DOS_debye}). 
Holding all other input parameters in Eq. \eqref{EQ:kvib} constant, 
a smaller sound speed leads to a larger $k_{pr}$ 
because the DOS scales as 
$DOS(\omega)\propto 1/v^3_{s}$. In this sense we can regard 
the prediction for $k_{pr}$ from 
our model of a-SiO2 as an upper bound. 
Our model confirms that propagating modes do not contribute 
significantly to the thermal conductivity of a-SiO2.
(footnote)

Assuming an $\omega^{-2}$ diffusivity scaling for a-Si 
the propagating, diffuson, and total thermal conductivity are 
0.63, 1.16, and 1.79 W/m-K. This value for total thermal conductivty 
is in agreement with the GK-predicted bulk value within the errors.
At 300 K for a-Si modeled by the Tersoff potential,   
$k_{ph} \approx k_{AF}$.\cite{he_heat_2011} Earlier studies using 
similar models of a-Si to those used in this work find 
that $k_{pr}$ is less than half of 
$k_{vib}$.\cite{feldman_thermal_1993,
feldman_numerical_1999} 
Estimates based on experimental measurements 
have shown $k_{pr}$ as low as 
$~20\%$\cite{cahill_thermal_1994,feldman_numerical_1999} 
and as high as $~80\%$ $k_{vib}$.
\cite{liu_high_2009,yang_anomalously_2010}

If an $\omega^{-4}$ scaling is assumed 
the resulting diverging conductivity at low frequency is fixed by 
using a boundary scattering model based on the Matthiessen 
rule and the thin-film thickness $t_f$,\cite{sellan_cross-plane_2010} 
\begin{equation}\label{EQ:LambdaMatth}
\begin{split}
\frac{1}{\Lambda_{eff}} = \frac{1}{\Lambda_{bulk}} + 
\frac{2}{t_f}.
\end{split}
\end{equation}
Using the largest film thickness from the experimental 
literature($80$ $\mu$m)(cite) gives a propagating contribution 
to thermal conductivity of $2.98$ W/m-K, much larger than the 
GK-predicted bulk conductivity. 
Using the $\omega^{-2}$ scaling and this film thickness 
gives a propagating contribution of 0.63 W/m-K. 
While predictions for $k_{pr}$ for a-Si 
depend on the experimental sample preparations
\cite{cahill_thermal_1994,
liu_high_2009,yang_anomalously_2010,regner_broadband_2013}
and the assumed scaling of the low-frequency 
vibrational diffusivities
\cite{feldman_thermal_1993,cahill_thermal_1994,
feldman_numerical_1999,liu_high_2009,yang_anomalously_2010} 
all evidence supports that $k_{pr}$ is a significant fraction 
of $k_{vib}$.
\cite{feldman_thermal_1993,cahill_thermal_1994,
feldman_numerical_1999,liu_high_2009,
yang_anomalously_2010,
he_heat_2011,regner_broadband_2013}

In Section \ref{S:Theory:Thermal} we approximated the specific heat 
of the propagating 
and non-propagating (diffusons) modes by the classical-limit 
value $C(\omega) = k_{B}$.    
The full quantum expression for the specific heat is
\begin{equation}\label{EQ:Cquantum}
\begin{split}
C(\omega) = k_{\text{B}}\left[\frac{\hbar\omega/2k_{\text{B}}T}
{sinh(\hbar\omega/2k_{\text{B}}T)}\right]^2,
\end{split}
\end{equation}
where $T$ is the temperature and 
$C(\omega) \approx k_{\text{B}}$ as 
$\omega/T$ goes to zero (classical limit).
\cite{feldman_thermal_1993} 
For a temperature $T=300$ K, 
$C(1.52 \times 10^{13}$ rads/s) = $0.98 k_{B}$, which is 
the largest $\omega_{cut}$ used for a-SiO2 or a-Si in this work. 
Using the 
classical limit for specific heat is a good approximation for the 
modes considered in $k_{pr}$, while it is an approximation for the 
high-frequency modes in our models. For a-SiO2(a-Si), the maximum 
frequency in the model is 
$\omega_{max} = 2.48 (1.22) \times 10^{14}$ rads$/$s and 
$C(\omega) = 0.073 (0.47) k_{B}$. Thus the quantum effect on 
$C(\omega)$ affects the 
contribution $k_{AF}$ only, which we can consider to be an 
temperature-dependent constant in $k_{vib}$. 
Using Eq. \eqref{EQ:Cquantum} gives 
$k_{AF} = 1.44 (1.00) $ W/m-K   
for a-SiO2(a-Si). This correction brings 
the overestimate of $k_{vib}$ for a-SiO2 into good  
agreement with experimental measurements.
\cite{cahill_lattice_1988,lee_heat_1997,
yamane_measurement_2002,regner_broadband_2013} 
For a-Si the modified $k_{AF}$ is closer to the classical-limit value, 
which does not significantly change the predicted $k_{vib}$. 
Because the change in $k_{AF}$ due to quantum effects are reasonably 
small for a-Si, 
we keep the classical-limit value.  
This allows us to verify that 
the $\omega^{-2}$ scaling (Eq. \eqref{EQ:tauw2} with $n=2$) 
describes the low-frequency contribution $k_{pr}$ for our model 
of bulk a-Si.

\subsection{\label{S:Accumulation}Accumulation Function}
%--------------------------------------------------------------------------

The broadband frequency domain thermal-reflectance 
measurments by Regner et al.,\cite{regner_broadband_2013}  
following the suggestion of Koh and Cahill,\cite{koh_frequency_2007} 
interpret the  
measured thermal conductivity at a given penetration depth 
to be representative of the so-called thermal conductivity accumulation 
function. Their results are plotted in Fig. \ref{FIG:sio2_accum} 
for a 1000 nm thick film of a-SiO2 
and in Fig. \ref{FIG:si_accum} for 500 nm (Regner A) and 
2000 nm (Regner B) thick films for a-Si.\cite{regner_broadband_2013} 
Based on the results in Section \ref{S:Diffusivities}, we will build 
thermal conductivity accumulation functions for a-SiO2 and a-Si from
\begin{equation}\label{EQ:matth}
k(\Lambda_{max}) = \frac{1}{V}\int^{\Lambda_{cut}}_{\Lambda_{max}} 
C(\Lambda) D(\Lambda)DOS(\Lambda)    
+k_{AF},
\end{equation},
where $\Lambda_{cut}$ is the MFP at the cut-off frequency, 
$\Lambda_{max}$ is the maximum MFP considered in the thermal 
conductivity accumulation, and the MFPs are 
caculated using Eq. \eqref{EQ:Lambda}. The 
diffuson contribution $k_{AF}$ is considered a constant 
(see Section \ref{S:Bulk}. The results are plotted 
in Figs. \ref{FIG:sio2_accum} and \ref{FIG:si_accum}. 

The predicted thermal conductivity accumulation function for a-SiO2 
saturates 
at a MFP of 10 nm, which is on the order of the finite size 
of our model. 
The predicted accumulation for a-SiO2 is 
demonstrates that 
propagating contribution is negligible (Section \ref{S:Bulk}). 
This result is in accord 
with the penetration depth-independent thermal 
conductivity measurements using broadband FDTR
\cite{regner_broadband_2013} and experimental measurements 
which show no film thickness dependance.
\cite{lee_heat_1997,yamane_measurement_2002}
While experiments show there is a cross-over region for the 
low-frequency diffusivity scaling of $\omega^{-2}$ and 
$\omega^{-4}$,
\cite{masciovecchio_evidence_2006,baldi_emergence_2013} 
the propagating contribution was is still shown to be negligible.
\cite{love_estimate_1990}
The cross-over region from $\omega^{-2}$ and 
$\omega^{-4}$ scaling observed in experiments for  
a-SiO2 occurs in the frequency range $4.6 10^9$ to 
$1.52 10^{10}$ rads$/$s,\cite{masciovecchio_evidence_2006} 
and $3.04 10^11$ to $1.52 10^{12}$ rads$/$s
\cite{baldi_emergence_2013}. 
Our present model is not 
large enough to investigate the cross-over region for $n=2$ to 
$n=4$ scaling. The required model size will most likely 
keep the required frequency range inaccessible for some 
time to come. 

For a-Si, the plateau of thermal conductivity in the   
measurements of Regner is consistent with our 
prediction of $k_{AF}$. 
For a-Si, the propagating contribution is predicted 
using both $\omega^{-2}$ and $\omega^{-4}$ scalings.  
As discussed in Section \ref{S:Conductivity}, 
the $\omega^{-2}$ scaling best describes the propagating 
contribution for our model of bulk a-Si. 
The thermal conductivity accumulation for the $\omega^{-2}$ 
scaling 
passes reasonably well through the largest penetration 
depth measurements of Regner, as well as some of the  
experimental measurements for varying film thicknesses.
The predicted $k_{vib}$ 
for varying film thickness follows roughly 
the accumulation 
function, so the experimentally-measured thermal conductivities 
are compared directly in Figs. \ref{FIG:sio2_accum} and 
\ref{FIG:si_accum}. The experimental measurements are grouped 
broadly by sample preparation technique: 
(A) chemical vapor deposition
\cite{moon_thermal_2002,liu_high_2009,yang_anomalously_2010}
and 
(B) sputtered.
\cite{kuo_thermal_1992,cahill_thermal_1994,wada_thermal_1996} 

We consider the $\omega^{-4}$ scaling with the boundary 
scattering model [Eq. \eqref{EQ:LambdaMatth}] and an 80,000 nm 
thick film. 
The measurements of Regner show much sharper accumulations 
than either $\omega^{-2}$ or $\omega^{-4}$ scalings, 
particularly for a film of thickness $2000$ nm. 
Because of the large variation in 
experimental measurements, predictions for both $\omega^{-2}$ 
and $\omega^{-4}$ pass reasonably well 
through the experimental measurments of Regner and 
thin films. 
Amorphous silicon can be
prepared only in thin films,(cite) where voids and other 
inhomogeneities are unavoidable\cite{li_effect_2011} and can 
influence the vibrational structure at low frequencies.
\cite{feldman_tight-binding_2004,liu_high_2009} Our models 
are not large enough to investigate the relevant frequency range 
($< 10^{12}$ rads$/$s) where the scaling 
transition may occur. 
It is worth noting again 
that the results from thin film experiments have been interpreted 
using both scalings.
\cite{feldman_thermal_1993,cahill_thermal_1994,
feldman_numerical_1999,liu_high_2009,yang_anomalously_2010} 

Experiments show there is a cross-over of the 
low-frequency diffusivity scaling in a-SiO2 of $\omega^{-4}$ to

Our present model is not 
large enough to investigate this frequency range. 
A transition between $\omega^{-4}$ and  
$\omega^{-2}$ scalings can be 
achieved using a phenomenological model where a cross-over frequency 
must be specified by experiment.
\cite{baldi_elastic_2011} While this cross-over frequency 
can be identified 
experimentally for a-SiO2,\cite{masciovecchio_evidence_2006} 
experiments are limited for a-Si thin films.

% The transverse sound speed predicted for our model of 
% a-SiO2 is about $85\%$ of that predicted by 
% the other methods used in the present study and that 
% measured by experiment.\cite{liu_high_2009}  
% While using a smaller transverse sound speed 
% leads to an underprediction of the 
% mode diffusivity scalings (Eq. \eqref{EQ:Dtau},
% Fig. \ref{FIG:diffusivities} ), it leads to an 
% overprediction of the DOS (Eq. \eqref{EQ:DOS_debye}). 
% Holding all other input parameters in Eq. \eqref{EQ:kvib} constant, 
% a smaller sound speed leads to a larger $k_{pr}$ 
% prediction because the DOS scales as 
% $DOS(\omega)\propto 1/v^3_{s}$. In this sense we can regard 
% the prediction for $k_{pr}$ from 
% our model of a-SiO2 with reduced transverse sound speeds  
% as an upper bound. 
% Our model confirms that propagating modes do not contribute significantly 
% to the thermal conductivity of a-SiO2.

% While experiments show there is a cross-over region for the 
% low-frequency diffusivity scaling from $n=2$ to $n=4$ scaling,
% \cite{masciovecchio_evidence_2006,baldi_emergence_2013} 
% the propagating contribution was still negligible. 
% The cross-over region from $n=2$ to $n=4$ observed in experiments for  
% a-SiO2 occurs in the frequency range $4.6 10^9$ to 
% $1.52 10^{10}$ rads$/$s,\cite{masciovecchio_evidence_2006} 
% and $3.04 10^11$ to $1.52 10^{12}$ rads$/$s
% \cite{baldi_emergence_2013}. 
% Our present model is not 
% large enough to investigate the cross-over region for $n=2$ to 
% $n=4$ scaling. The required model size will most likely 
% keep the required frequency range inaccessible for some 
% time to come. 

% A transition between $n=2$ and $n=4$ scaling can be 
% achieved using a phenomenological model where a cross-over frequency 
% must be specified by experiment.
% \cite{baldi_elastic_2011} While this cross-over can be identified 
% experimentally for a-SiO2,\cite{masciovecchio_evidence_2006} 
% experiments are limited for a-Si thin films.(cite) 
% Our model for bulk a-Si seems best described by a propagating 
% contribution $k_{pr}$ using Eq. \eqref{EQ:Dw2} with $n=2$ (see Fig. ). 
% Using the boundary 
% scattering model Eq. \eqref{matth} to  predict the thermal conductivity 
% accumulation function in Fig. with $n=2$ and $n=4$ shows that 
% the experimental measurements for a-Si thin films are still not 
% well-understood. Our model can describe the accumulations predicted 
% by broadband FDTR measurements by Regner only qualitatively in the 
% short and long MFP limits. 
% While the low-frequency scaling of the 
% diffusivities has been investigated experimentally for a-SiO2, 
% experimental measurements for a-Si are lacking. Measurements 
% of the thermal conductivity of a-Si thin films with varying 
% temperature suggest both 
% $n=2$(cite) and 
% $n=4$(cite) 
% separately based on varying preparation techniques. 

% This supports the idea of Slack for a-SiO$_2$\cite{slack_thermal_1979}
% While the thermal conductivity of a-SiO , the material is characterized by 
% a constant similar for other amorphous
% materials such as Lennard-Jones argon\cite{larkin_predicting_2013} 
% and a model of a-GeTe.\cite{sosso_thermal_2012}
% 
% That the amorphous phase
% of Si should have a lower GHz attenuation than many other
% amorphous materials is not entirely surprising, as the 2002
% review of low-temperature thermal conductivity and internal
% friction by Pohl, Liu, and Thompson certainly indicates that
% the fourfold coordinated materials tend to demonstrate weaker
% anharmonicity.\cite{pohl_low-temperature_2002}
% 
% Theoretical predictions of acoustic attenuation in amor-
% phous solids generally agree that at room temperature, a
% quadratic frequency dependence is expected in the frequency
% range of 10 GHz–1 THz and its origins are expected to be
% the anharmonicity of the interatomic bonds.
% 
% Theory from Schirmacher et al. predicted 
% an w4 scaling below a system dependent onset frequency.

\section{\label{S:Lifetimes}Summary}
%--------------------------------------------------------------------------

In this work we investigated the contributions of propagating ($k_{ph}$) 
and non-propagating ($k_{AF}$) modes to the total vibrational 
thermal conductivity $k_{vib}$ of two amorphous materials, 
a-SiO2 and a-Si, using the NMD method (Section \ref{S:Life}), 
GK method (Section \ref{S:Bulk}), 
and AF theory (Section \ref{S:Diffusivities}). 
Using the NMD method and the AF theory, 
we predict the total thermal conductivity $k_{vib}$ and its 
contributions from propagating ($k_{pr}$) and non-propagating 
($k_{AF}$) using a bottom-up approach 
based on the mode-by-mode properties. Using the GK method and very-large 
models (including the largest simulated model of a-Si we are aware of), 
we predict $k_{vib}$ of bulk a-SiO2 and a-Si. For our model of bulk a-Si 
the thermal conductivity has  
significant contribution from propagating modes which are best described 
by a diffusivity scaling of $\omega^{-2}$ 
(see Section \ref{S:Theory:Thermal}).  
For a-SiO2, the contribution from propagating modes was shown to 
be negligible (Section \ref{S:Bulk}). 
The is confirmed by experimental thin film measurements
\cite{love_estimate_1990,baldi_thermal_2008} 
and broadband frequency domain thermalreflectance measurements  
by Regner.\cite{regner_broadband_2013} 

The thermal conductivity accumulation functions predicted for a-Si 
using both $\omega^{-2}$ 
and $\omega^{-4}$ scalings show reasonable agreement 
with the experimental measurments.
\cite{feldman_thermal_1993,cahill_thermal_1994,
feldman_numerical_1999,liu_high_2009,yang_anomalously_2010,
regner_broadband_2013} 
The large discrepancies between measurments of 
a-Si thin films suggest that a comprehensive 
experimental study is necessary on varying film thicknesses 
and preparation techniques.  
It may be particularly helpful to perform the broadband techniques
\cite{koh_frequency_2007,minnich_thermal_2011,regner_broadband_2013} 
at temperatures less than $< 10$ K where the propagating contribution 
dominates $k_{vib}$ for both a-SiO2 and a-Si.
