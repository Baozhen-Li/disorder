Understanding thermal transport in crystalline systems requires detailed 
knowledge of phonons, which are the quanta of energy associated with atomic 
vibrations. By definition, phonons are non-localized vibrations that 
transport energy over distances much larger than the atomic spacing. For 
disordered materials (e.g., alloys, amorphous phases), with the exception 
of very long-wavelength (low-frequency) modes, the vibrational modes are 
localized and do 
not propagate like phonons. The film thickness and temperature dependence 
of thermal conductivity measured by experiments show indirectly that 
propagating modes contribute 
significantly for a-Si but not a-SiO2, with contribution from vibrational 
modes with large mean free paths (100-1000 nm). Recent measurements using a 
broadband FDTR technique argue that these vibrational mean free paths can 
be probed by varying the penetration depth to measure the 
thermal conductivity accumulation function. 
Using lattice dynamics calculations and molecular dynamics simulations on 
realistic models of a-SiO2 and a-Si, we predict and 
characterize the contributions from phonons and localized vibrations to 
vibrational thermal conductivity. The vibrational mean free paths are 
predicted for these two amorphous materials and the thermal 
conductivity accumulation function is compared with experimental 
results, particularly from Regner et al.

Amorphous silicon (a-Si) and nanocrystalline silicon have applications 
in high-efficiency solar cells.(cite) 
Films and substrates made of a-SiO2 and a-Si have wide application.
(cite) Understanding the thermal transport in these amorphous systems 
is critical to improving their performance. 
Thermal transport at scales comparable to phonon wave-
lengths and mean free paths (MFPs) is presently a topic of
considerable interest.\cite{cahill_nanoscale_2003,
yu_reduction_2010,hochbaum_enhanced_2008,pernot_precise_2010}
Recently, nanostructured materials
such as nanowires, superlattices, and composites with
strongly reduced thermal conductivities due to phonon
scattering at interfaces and boundaries have been reported
and are being considered for use in thermoelectric applications.
\cite{hochbaum_enhanced_2008,pernot_precise_2010,
boukai_silicon_2008,poudel_high-thermoelectric_2008}
Recent empirical and first-principles calculations
show that MFPs of phonons relevant to thermal conduc-
tivity vary by more than 5 orders of magnitude in crystalline 
materials.\cite{ward_intrinsic_2010}
Traditionally, empirical expressions and
simple relaxation time models have been the only means
to estimate MFPs.\cite{holland_analysis_1963} 

Experimentally, inelastic neutron scattering has been
used to measure phonon lifetimes in certain materials,
but this technique is more suited for single crystal samples.
\cite{christianson_phonon_2008} 
Koh et al. proposed a time-domain thermal reflectance (TDTR) 
technique which uses a variation of
modulation frequency to measure MFPs, but this technique
is limited by the modulation frequency.
\cite{koh_frequency_2007}
An x-ray diffraction and thermoreflectance technique
can measure ballistic transport in some structures.
\cite{highland_ballistic-phonon_2007}
The thermal conductivity accumulation function can be 
predicted for bulk crystalline systems using TDTR and 
frequency-domain thermal reflectance (FDTR) techniques.
(cite) 
The understanding of the accumulation function for bulk 
crystalline is understood fairly well experimentally
\cite{minnich_thermal_2011}
and 
theoretically.\cite{yang_mean_2013} However, understanding 
of the accumulation in amorphous systems is still not 
well understood.
\cite{feldman_thermal_1993,cahill_thermal_1994,
feldman_numerical_1999,liu_high_2009,yang_anomalously_2010,
he_thermal_2011}
Recent measurements by Regner using broadband FDTR 
argue that the thermal conductivity accumulation function 
can be measured by varying the penetration depth of the 
experimental measurement.\cite{regner_broadband_2013}

Experimental measurements of the thermal conductivity of
thin films of a-SiO2 and a-Si at varying temperatures 
gives indirect information about the low-frequency, propagating 
modes.(cite) For a-SiO2, 
varying temperature 
and film thickness
\cite{lee_heat_1997,yamane_measurement_2002} 
measurements all suggest that the propagating modes 
contribute a negligible amount to thermal conductivity. 
However, the behavior of the low-frequency modes 
has only recently been understood by experimental 
measurements,
\cite{masciovecchio_evidence_2006,baldi_thermal_2008,
baldi_sound_2010,baldi_elastic_2011,baldi_emergence_2013} 
where a cross-over of the low-frequency scaling of 
the vibrational lifetimes from Rayleigh (quartic)(cite) 
to Umklapp (quadratic)(cite) is observed.

For a-Si the low-frequency behavior is less understood. Temperature 
varying(cite) and film thickness-varying measurements
\cite{hasselman_thermal_1989,wada_thermal_1996,zink_thermal_2006,
yang_anomalously_2010,cahill_thermal_1994,kuo_thermal_1992,
moon_thermal_2002,liu_high_2009}
suggest multiple and different behavior of the low-frequency 
scaling of the mean free paths of vibrational modes in a-Si. 
Comparison of experimental measurements by 
Pompe\cite{pompe_thermal_1988} and Cahill
\cite{cahill_thermal_1989,cahill_thermal_1994} show a plateau of 
thermal conductivity with temperature, 
which can be predicted by the the model from FKAW which assumes a 
$\omega^{-4}$ scaling.\cite{feldman_thermal_1993}
Low temperature conductivity and specific heat measurements demonstrate 
that the propagating modes in a-Si and doped a-Si follow 
$\Lambda \propto \omega^{-2}$,
\cite{zink_thermal_2006,zink_excess_2006} where no 
thermal conductivity plateau is observed
\cite{zink_thermal_2006,zink_excess_2006,yang_anomalously_2010} 
There is a clear film thickness $t_f$ dependence of the thermal 
conductivity of a-Si, particularly for $t_f>$ 10 $\mu$m,
(cite) where conductivities of $1.4-6$ W/m-K have been reported.
(cite) 
Both quadratic\cite{feldman_numerical_1999} 
and 
quartic\cite{feldman_thermal_1993,cahill_lower_1994,
yang_anomalously_2010} 
scalings of the low-frequency MFPs 
have been considered to explain these experimental measurements. 
More experimental measurements are needed to understand 
the low-frequency behavior in a-Si thin films.(cite) 

Low temperature conductivity and specific heat measurements demonstrate 
that the propagating modes in a-Si and doped a-Si follow 
$\Lambda \propto \omega^{-2}$.
\cite{zink_thermal_2006,zink_excess_2006} 
Comparison of experimental measurements by 
Pompe\cite{pompe_thermal_1988} and Cahill
\cite{cahill_thermal_1989,cahill_thermal_1994} show a plateau of 
thermal conductivity with temperature, 
which can be predicted by the the theory from FKAW which assumes a 
$\omega^{-4}$ scaling.\cite{feldman_thermal_1993}  
Zink et al. measured the thermal conductivity of e-beam
evaporated amorphous silicon thin films over a wide tem-
perature range and found now plateau, which is predicted from the 
FAB theory and an $\omega^{-2}$ scaling.\cite{feldman_numerical_1999}  

In this work, we perform Molecular Dynamics (MD) simulations and 
Lattice Dynamics calculations on  
large models of a-SiO2 and a-Si. The results are used to 
understand recent experimental measurements using a broadband 
frequency domain thermal reflectance (FDTR) technique with varying 
penetration depths $L_p$.\cite{regner_broadband_2013}
Large MD 
simulations of models for a-SiO2 show (within the errors) no 
dependence on the system size, indicating that propagating modes 
do not make a significant contribution to thermal conductivity. 
This is confirmed by modal analysis, which demonstrates that 
propagating modes contribute a negligible amount to thermal 
conductivity. At low frequency, a quadratic scaling of the 
vibrational mode lifetimes is a reasonable fit to the predictions, 
in agreement with previous models of a-SiO2.(cite)

We predict the thermal conductivity of bulk a-Si using (to our 
knowledge) the largest MD simulation for a model of a-Si.(cite) 
Scaling 
of thermal conductivity with system size indicates that the 
low-frequency propagating modes in bulk a-Si follow a Debye-like model 
with a quadratic scaling of the mode lifetime with frequency.
(cite) 
A modal analysis of a large a-Si model supports the evidence 
for quadratic scaling of lifetimes at low frequency,  
which is not definitive using the AF diffuson theory.
\cite{feldman_thermal_1993,feldman_numerical_1999} The propagating 
modes are found to contribute significantly to the thermal 
conductivity of a-Si an amount similar to that predicted by 
other models of a-Si.(cite)

The spectrum of vibrational MFPs and the accumulated thermal conductivity
(cite) 
are predicted for a-SiO2 and a-Si. The thermal conductivity for our model 
of a-SiO2 accumulates within $95\%$ of its bulk value for vibrational 
mean free paths (MFPs) $<$ 10 nm. 
This result explains the experimental measurements 
of Regner et al, which show no measured dependence of the thermal 
conductivity on $L_p$,\cite{regner_broadband_2013} and experimental 
measurements of the thermal conductivity of thin films which 
show no dependence on film thickness.(cite) 

Using a simple boundary scattering model, the accumulated thermal 
conductivity of a-Si thin films are predicted from our model 
of bulk a-Si. The predicted accumulated thermal conductivity 
reproduces the experimentally measured penetration depth-dependent 
thermal conductivity qualitatively.(cite) We consider both 
quadratic and quartic 
scalings of the low-frequency 
vibrational lifetimes. 
By considering both scalings, our model of thin-film a-Si thermal 
conductivity accumulation can span the range of the 
lower(cite) and 
higher\cite{liu_high_2009,yang_anomalously_2010} 
experimentally measured thermal conductivity of varying thickness 
a-Si thin films. 

The predicted contribution to thermal conductivity of 
non-propagating modes from our model of a-Si is in good agreement 
with the plateau of accumulated thermal conductivity from broadband 
FTDR. The quadratic scaling of low-frequency mode lifetimes 
does not predict the steep dependence of thermal conductivity on
$L_p$, while the quartic scaling can qualitatively. Given the 
lack of experimental measurements of the low-frequency scaling of 
vibrational mode lifetimes,(cite) low-temperature broadband FDTR 
measurements can help to show which scaling, quadratic or 
quartic, is present in a-Si thin films with varying deposition 
technique. The results could answer the question of whether 
quartic versus quadratic scaling is responsible for the large 
thickness variation of the thermal conductivity of a-Si thin films.

To calculate the total vibrational thermal conductivity $k_{vib}$ 
of amorphous solids, we predict 
the contributions from $k_{ph}$ and $k_{AF}$, 
\begin{equation}\label{EQ:kvib}
\begin{split}
k_{vib} = k_{ph} + k_{AF},
\end{split}
\end{equation}
where $k_{ph}$\cite{ashcroft_solid_1976,dove_introduction_1993,
ziman_electrons_2001} is the contribution from phonons or 
phonon-like modes and $k_{AF}$ is the contribution from the 
Allen-Feldman (AF) theory of diffusons.
\cite{feldman_thermal_1993} The form of Eq. \eqref{EQ:kvib}
has been used in 
several previous studies with varying assumptions. The various 
assumptions all lead to predictions that $k_{ph}$ is a significant 
fraction($> 20\%$) of $k_{vib}$.(cite)  

We predict 
the contribution $k_{ph}$ using a Debye-like model,
\begin{equation}\label{EQ:kph}
\begin{split}
k_{ph} = \frac{1}{V}\int_{0}^{\omega_{cut}} 
d\omega DOS(\omega) C(\omega) D(\omega),
\end{split}
\end{equation}
and the diffuson contribution $k_{AF}$ using
\cite{feldman_thermal_1993,feldman_numerical_1999}
\begin{equation}\label{EQ:kAF}
\begin{split}
k_{AF} = \frac{1}{V}\sum_{\omega_i>\omega_{cut}} C_i(\omega) D_{AF,i}(\omega) 
\end{split}
\end{equation}
The phonon contribution $k_{ph}$ is written as an integral because 
the finite simulation sizes studied in this work (and others)
\cite{feldman_thermal_1993,feldman_numerical_1999}
limit the lowest 
frequency vibrational modes which can be studied. The diffuson contribution 
$k_{AF}$ is written as a sum because there are enough high-frequency 
diffuson modes in the finite-size systems studied.
\cite{feldman_thermal_1993,feldman_numerical_1999}  
The cut-off frequency $\omega_{cut}$ identifies the transition from 
phonon-like to diffuson modes.
\cite{feldman_thermal_1993,cahill_thermal_1994,
feldman_numerical_1999,liu_high_2009,yang_anomalously_2010}

Phonon-like behavior 
can be identified for a-Si in this work and others, 
both experimentally
\cite{liu_high_2009,yang_anomalously_2010,minnich_thermal_2011,
regner_broadband_2013} 
and numerically.
\cite{feldman_thermal_1993,feldman_numerical_1999,
mcgaughey_thermal_2004,he_heat_2011} 
Including the phonon-like contribution $k_{ph}$ 
for a-Si is not qualitatively sensitive 
to the choice of model
\cite{feldman_thermal_1993,feldman_numerical_1999,liu_high_2009} 
or $\omega_{cut}$.
\cite{feldman_thermal_1993,feldman_numerical_1999,
donadio_atomistic_2009,liu_high_2009,yang_anomalously_2010}

In this work, we identify the phonon limit by $\omega_{cut}$ in 
Eq. \eqref{EQ:kvib}, 
in Section \ref{S:Diffusivities}. By identifying $\omega_{cut}$   
the contribution of phonon-like modes in a-Si and 
a-SiO$_2$ is quantified in Section \ref{S:Bulk} and 
the thermal conductivity accumulation 
is predicted in Section \ref{S:Accumulation}.

Eq. \ref{EQ:kph} can be derived starting 
with the Kubo theory,
\cite{flicker_lattice_1973,allen_thermal_1993,alam_lattice_2005,
baldi_thermal_2008,yang_anomalously_2010} which is used to derive 
the Allen-Feldman diffuson theory,\ref{feldman_thermal_1993} 
and taking the limit 
of zero phonon self-energy.\cite{baldi_thermal_2008} 
Eq. \eqref{EQ:kph} can also be obtained using the single-mode relaxation
time approximation to solve 
the Boltzmann transport equation.\cite{ziman_electrons_2001}  
Assumed in Eq. \eqref{EQ:kph} 
are isotropy (valid for an amorphous material) and a single phonon 
polarization,(cite) making the  
properties a function of the mode frequency $\omega$ only. The 
choice of a single phonon polarization (i.e., an averaging 
of the transverse and longitudinal branches)(cite) does not 
significantly change 
the results predicted in this work or others.
\cite{feldman_thermal_1993,cahill_thermal_1994,
feldman_numerical_1999,baldi_thermal_2008,liu_high_2009,
yang_anomalously_2010} 

For a phonon gas, Eq. \eqref{EQ:kph} has mode diffusivity   
\begin{equation}\label{EQ:Dtau}
\begin{split}
D(\omega) = \frac{1}{3}v^2_g(\omega)\tau(\omega).
\end{split}
\end{equation}
The physical picture is of propagating plane waves which 
travel with velocity $v_g$ for a time $\tau$ before scattering. 
An equivalent physical picture in terms of a scattering length 
is
\begin{equation}\label{EQ:DLambda}
\begin{split}
D(\omega) = \frac{1}{3}v_g(\omega) \Lambda(\omega),
\end{split}
\end{equation}
where $\Lambda$ is the phonon mean free path (MFP), defined as 
\begin{equation}\label{EQ:Lambda}
\begin{split}
\Lambda(\omega) = v_{g}(\omega) \tau(\omega).
\end{split}
\end{equation}
Both Eqs. \eqref{EQ:Dtau} and \eqref{EQ:DLambda} are
valid in the propagating limit, 
i.e. the Ioffe-Regel (IR) limit.(cite)

In disordered system, Eqs. and  are only valid in the 
low-frequency, long-wavelength limit.(cite) 
Because of this, we focus on the mode 
diffusivity $D$ as the fundamental quantity. 
The phonon thermal diffusivity, $D_{ph}(\omega)$, is modeled using 
\begin{equation}\label{EQ:Dw2}
\begin{split}
D_{ph}(\omega) = B\omega^{-2} 
\end{split}
\end{equation}
which is a scaling predicted for Umklapp phonon-phonon scattering,
(cite callaway) and
\begin{equation}\label{EQ:Dw4}
\begin{split}
D_{ph}(\omega) = B\omega^{-4} 
\end{split}
\end{equation}
which is the scaling predicted by Rayleigh scattering.
\cite{klemens_scattering_1955} Both scalings Eqs. and also assume 

Since we use MD simulations, which are classical 
and obey Maxwell-Boltzmann 
statistics,\cite{mcquarrie_statistical_2000} we take the phonon and diffuson 
specific heat to be $C(\omega) = C(\omega_i) = \frac{k_{\text{B}}}{V}$ in the 
harmonic limit, where $V$ 
is the system volume. This harmonic approximation has been shown to be valid 
for a-Si modeled using the Stillinger-Weber potential at the temperatures of 
interest here.(cite)  
Taking the classical limit for the specific heat allows for a direct 
comparison between 
the MD- and lattice dynamics-based methods. 

Under the Debye approximation, 
which assumes isotropic and linear dispersion (i.e., $v_g = v_s$), 
the density of states, $DOS(\omega)$, is
\begin{equation}\label{EQ:DOS_debye}
DOS(\omega) = \frac{3\pi\omega^2}{2v_{s,DOS}^3},
\end{equation}
where $v_s$ is an appropriate sound speed.(cite)

The form for $D(\omega)$ (Eq. \eqref{EQ:Dw2}) 
and the $DOS(\omega)$ (Eq. \eqref{EQ:DOS_debye}) 
cause a cancellation of $\omega$ dependence in 
Eq. \eqref{EQ:kph} and ensures that the 
thermal conductivity is finite. The form for $D(\omega)$ 
(Eq. \eqref{EQ:Dw4}) causes the thermal conductivity 
(Eq. \eqref{EQ:kph}) to diverge 
in the low-frequency limit as the system size is increased as 
$L^{1/4}$.(cite)  

ENDALAN

While the classic limit for the mode specific heat is 
an over-prediction for the high frequency modes in a-Si, 
the non-propagating contribution 
predicted by broadband FTDR matches the prediction from the AF diffuson theory.
Adjusting the specific heats to include quantum statistical effects...

We can thus focus on the less understood low-frequency propagating contribution. 

Because we use molecular dynamics (MD) simulations, we

In general, the thermal conductivity $k_{ph}$ and group velocity 
$v_{g}$ depend on the spatial direction $\mathbf{n}$. 
Since the amorphous materials studied in this work are isotropic, 
$k_{ph}$ and $v_{g}$ are scalar quantities independent of the direction 
$\mathbf{n}$.

BEGINALAN

For disordered systems, the vibrational modes are no 
longer pure plane-waves (i.e., phonon modes), except in the low-frequency 
(long-wavelength) limit.(cite) When applied in the classical limit, 
the Allen-Feldman (AF) theory computes 
the contribution of diffusive, non-propagating modes (i.e., diffusons) 
to thermal conductivity\cite{allen_thermal_1993} 
\begin{equation}\label{EQ:DAF}
\begin{split}
D_{AF,i} = \frac{\pi V^2}{\hbar^2\omega^2_i}\sum_{j\neq i}
|\left< i | J_{x,y,z} | j \right>|^2 \delta(\omega_i - \omega_j)
\end{split}
\end{equation}
where $D_{AF,i}$ is the mode diffusivity and $\omega_i$ is the 
frequency of the $i$th diffuson. The diffusivity of diffusons 
can be calculated from harmonic lattice dynamics theory.

BEGINALAN

The relative contribution of $k_{ph}$ and $k_{AF}$ to $k_{vib}$ 
has been estimated 
to be approximately equal for a model of a-Si  
at 300 K,\cite{he_heat_2011} 
while earlier studies find that $k_{ph}$ is less than half.
\cite{feldman_thermal_1993,
feldman_numerical_1999} Assuming a constant contribution  
$k_{AF} ~ 1$ W/m-K, experimental 
measurements and estimates show that the contribution from 
$k_{ph}$ is low as $~20\%$,
\cite{cahill_thermal_1994,feldman_numerical_1999} 
$~40\%$,\cite{liu_high_2009} and as high as,
\cite{yang_anomalously_2010} all depending on the assumed 
scaling of the low-frequency vibrational scattering. 
The thermal conductivity $k_{vib}$ has also been estimated for 
a-GeTe\cite{sosso_thermal_2012}, where $\k_{ph}\approx 0$ and 
$k_{vib} \approx k_{AF}$, and silicon nanowires,
\cite{donadio_atomistic_2009} where $k_{ph}\approx k_{AF}$. 

For disordered materials In the low-frequency, long-wavelength limit, 
the mode thermal diffusivity 
has the form of Eq. \eqref{EQ:Dw2} or \eqref{EQ:Dw4}.(cite)  
The mode diffusivities 
generally decrease with increasing frequency,(cite) often reaching a 
plateau,(cite) and then decrease exponentially to zero as the modes become 
localized.(cite) Diffuson thermal diffusivities, 
Eq. \eqref{EQ:DAF}, cannot 
in general be 
expressed as either Eq. \eqref{EQ:Dtau} or \eqref{EQ:DLambda}.  
For disordered systems, the mode group velocities, 
lifetimes, MFPs cannot be estimated independently.
\cite{allen_thermal_1993,feldman_thermal_1993,
feldman_numerical_1999,allen_evolution_1998,larkin_predicting_2013}

It is useful to consider a high-scatter limit for the mode diffusivity,
\begin{equation}\label{EQ:D_HS}
D_{HS} = \frac{1}{3} v_s a,
\end{equation}
where it is assumed that all vibrational modes travel with the sound speed, 
$v_s$, and scatter over a distance of the lattice constant, $a$. This 
diffusivity assumption leads to a high-scatter (HS) limit of thermal 
conductivity in the classical limit\cite{cahill_lattice_1988} 
\begin{equation}\label{EQ:k_HS}
k_{HS} = \frac{k_{\text{B}}}{V_b}b v_s a,
\end{equation}
where $V_b$ is the volume of the unit cell and $b$ is the number of atoms 
in the unit cell. 

For amorphous systems, the 
spatial disorder creates strong scattering, and $k_{vib}$ tends to be 
near the high-scatter limit $k_{HS}$.(cite) 
It was demonstrated by Kittel that  
the thermal conductivity of glasses above 20 K could be interpreted 
using a temperature-independent high-scatter diffusivity on the order 
of Eq. \eqref{EQ:D_HS}.  
Since this corresponds to a phonon model with MFP $\Lambda = a$, 
too small to justify use of the model, implies that the dominant 
modes in most glasses are diffusons and not phonons.(cite)  

One way to interpret this result is to use assume 
$k_{vib} = k_{AF} = k_{HS}$. Amorphous Lennard-Jones argon is dominated 
by high-scatter modes,\cite{larkin_predicting_2013} as is a model of 
a-GeTe, and both their $k_{vib} \approx k_{HS}$.\cite{sosso_thermal_2012} 
For a-SiO$_2$, $k_{vib} \approx 2k_{HS}$, while it is unclear what the 
appropriate lattice constant $a$ should be.(cite)   
For a-Si, the experimentally measured thermal conductivity at 
300 K $k_{vib} \approx (1-6) k_{HS}$,\cite{cahill_lower_1992}  
indicating that there may be a large contribution from $k_{ph}$.

While Eqs. and are commonly used to establish a high-scatter limit for 
diffusivity and thermal conductivity, predictions for a-SiGe alloys 
demonstrated that these are not true high-scatter limits.
\cite{feldman_thermal_1993} Recently, the thermal conductivity 
of several materials has been measured to be significantly below 
$k_{HS}$.(cite) 

By using lattice dynamics calculations and molecular dynamics simulations, 
we predict the inputs to Eq. \eqref{EQ:kvib} in Sections \ref{S:DOS}, 
\ref{S:Structure}, 
and \ref{S:Diffusivities}. The 
thermal conductivity $k_{vib}$ is predicted in Section 
\ref{S:Conductivity}. 
The MFPs of phonons and diffusons are predicted the thermal 
conductivity accumulation is predicted in 
Section \ref{S:Accumulation}.

We discuss the sample preparations...There are several methods available 
which can use empirical and ab-initio-derived interatomic potentials.
(cite) We use models for a-SiO2 and a-Si which have been used previously 
in the literature.(cite) 

%--------------------------------------------------------------------------
\subsubsection{\label{S:Sample:Si}Amorphous Si}
%--------------------------------------------------------------------------

For a-Si, we use models created by the Wooten-Winer-Weaire (WWW) algorithm in  
Ref. \citenum{barkema_high-quality_2000}.  Sample sizes with $N_a$ =  
216, 1000, 4096, and 100,000 were provided, where $N_a$ are the number of 
atoms in the disordered supercell.(cite)  
A large sample was created from the $N_a = 100,000$ sample 
by treating it 
as a unit cell and tiling twice in all directions to create an 
$N_a = 800,000$ sample with box size $L$ nm. 
All a-Si structures used have a density $\rho$ equivalent to the perfect 
crystal with a lattice constant of $a=$5.43 $\AA$.(cite) 

The Stillinger-Weber potential is 
used with these samples.  
The samples were annealed at a temperature of 1100 K for 5 ns to remove 
meta-stability. Amorphous materials have many different atomic 
(potential energy) 
configurations with nearly equivalent energies.
\cite{durandurdu_<i>ab_2002,bernstein_structural_2006} 
The removal of meta-stability is demonstrated 
by an increase in the predicted sound speeds, 
$v_{s,T}$ and $v_{S,L}$, after 
annealing (see Table ).\cite{bernstein_structural_2006} 
This meta-stability can 
cause errors when predicting vibrational lifetimes using Normal 
Mode Decomposition (NMD, see Section \ref{S:Life}).(cite) 

Similar lifetimes can be obtained with a-Si samples 
created using a melt-quench-anneal procedure(cite), 
see Section \ref{S:Sample}. 

(footnote)In an amorphous material, there are many potential energy 
configurations 
(atomic positions) which are nearly equivalent in energy.  At a sufficient 
temperature, the meta-stable configurations cause the equilibrium 
atomic positions to vary in time.  This can effect on the prediction of 
the vibrational mode 
lifetimes when using the normal 
mode decomposition method. In the time domain, the average normal 
mode potential and kinetic energy must be calculated and subtracted 
from the normal mode energy autocorrelation function.(cite) 
If the average 
energy is not specified correctly, unphysically large or small mode 
lifetimes can be predicted.(cite) 

(footnote)
The entire procedure is performed at constant volume. Crystalline 
silicon (c-Si) is first 
melted at a temperature of 10,000 K. The liquid is then quenched 
instantaneously to 300 K, and then annealed at 1100 K for 10 ns to remove 
meta-stability.

\subsubsection{\label{S:Sample:SiO2}Amorphous SiO$_2$}
%--------------------------------------------------------------------------

The a-SiO$_2$ samples are used from Ref. \citenum{mcgaughey_thermal_2004} 
and have size $N_a =$ 288 , 576, and 972. The atomic potentials used 
for a-SiO$_2$ are the same as in Ref. 
\citenum{mcgaughey_thermal_2004} except the 24-6 
Lennard-Jones potential is changed to a 12-6, 
which has a negligible effect on the predictions presented in this paper. 
Larger systems of $N_a = $ 2880, 4608, and 34562 are created by a similar 
melt-quench technique as that used in Ref. \citenum{mcgaughey_thermal_2004}

\subsection{\label{S:Simulation}Simulation Details}
%--------------------------------------------------------------------------

Molecular dynamics simulations are performed using the disordered 
a-SiO$_2$ and a-Si supercells described in 
Section \ref{S:Sample}. 
The MD simulations were performed using LAMMPS\cite{plimpton_fast_1995}  
with time steps of dt = 0.00905 , 0.0005 for a-SiO$_2$ and a-Si. 
Ten MD simulations with different initial conditions were run 
for $2^21$ time steps and the atomic trajectories sampled 
ever $2^8$ time steps. For the GK method, the thermal conductivity 
$k_{GK}$ is 
predicted by window averaging the integral of the heat current 
autocorrelation function (HCACF).(cite) For a-SiO$_2$ and s-Si, a interval 
of the the HCACF integral can be found which is constant within the 
statistical noise.(cite) Large system sizes up to $N_a = $ 34,000 and 
800,000 can be used to predict $k_{GK}$ for a-SiO$_2$ and a-Si 
(see Section \ref{S:Sample:Si}). For smaller 
systems, the trajectories from the MD simulations used for the GK method 
are also used in the NMD method to predict the vibrational mode 
lifetimes (Section \ref{S:Life}). 

For the amorphous supercells studied,
the only allowed wave vector is the gamma-point (i.e., $\pmb{\kappa}=0$),  
where $\pmb{\kappa}$ is the wavevector and there are $3N_a$ polarization 
branches labeled by $\nu$. 
Calculation of the 
vibrational modes at the Gamma point require the eigenvalue solution 
of a dynamical matrix of size 
$(3N_a)^2$ that scales as $[(3N_a)^2]^3$, limiting the system 
sizes that can be considered to $N_a = 4608$ and 4096 for a-SiO$_2$ and a-Si. 
This eigenvalue solution is also required to perform the NMD 
(see Section \ref{S:Life})  
and AF calculations (see Section \ref{S:Diffusivities}). 
The frequencies and eigenvectors were computed using harmonic
lattice dynamics calculations and GULP.\cite{gale_general_2003} 
The calculation of the AF diffuson thermal diffusivities 
(Eq. \eqref{EQ:DAF}) 
is performed using GULP and a Lorentzian 
broadening of $5\delta\omega_{avg}$ and $14\delta\omega_{avg}$ for 
a-Si and a-SiO$^2$, where $\delta\omega_{avg}$ is the average mode 
frequency spacing.(cite) Varying the broadening around these values does not 
change the resulting thermal conductivity $k_{AF}$ significantly 
(see Section ).

\subsection{\label{S:DOS}Density of States}
%--------------------------------------------------------------------------

BEGINALAN

In this section, we examine the frequencies and density of states (DOS)  
for the vibrational modes of a-SiO$_2$ and a-Si. 
The vibrational DOS is computed by 
\begin{equation}\label{EQ:DOS}
DOS(\omega) = \sum_i \delta(\omega_i - \omega),
\end{equation}
where a unit step function is used to broaden 
$\delta(\omega_i - \omega)$.(cite)  
The DOS for a-SiO$_2$ and a-Si are plotted in Fig. \ref{FIG:DOS} 
using two values of 
broadening, $10\delta\omega_{avg}$ and $100\delta\omega_{avg}$.  
Because of the finite model size, the low-frequency modes are sparse and 
the DOS has a large variability dependent on the broadening.
\cite{feldman_numerical_1999} 
As the system size $L$ is increased, the lowest frequency mode will 
continue to decrease and the gaps in frequency will fill in.(cite)  
The DOS for a-Si is similar to the 
DOS of crystalline silicon,
\cite{williams_numerical_1985,donadio_atomistic_2009} particularly 
at low-frequency, and with pronounced features as in disordered lattices.
\cite{larkin_predicting_2013,beltukov_ioffe-regel_2013} The DOS for 
a-SiO$_2$ is essentially constant over most of the frequency-range, 
except at the lowest frequencies. 

While the DOS has a large amount of variability at low frequency, 
there is a clear scaling of $DOS \propto \omega^{-2}$ for both 
a-Si and a-SiO$_2$. The range of this 
scaling is larger for a-Si than a-SiO$_2$. 
By fitting the DOS 
from Fig. \ref{FIG:DOS} to Eq. \eqref{EQ:DOS_debye}, 
a sound speed is predicted and 
reported in Table \ref{T:vs} and discussed in Section \ref{S:DOS}. 
The Debye model predicts 
that the contribution from the larger longitudinal sound speed 
compared to the smaller transverse sound speed will scale as the 
difference cubed. For a-Si, 
the contribution from longitudinal modes to the Debye DOS is nearly 
an order of magnitude less than the transverse modes for a given 
frequency interval. For a-SiO$_2$, the longitudinal and transverse 
sound speeds are closer.(cite experimental DOS) 

The intensity of the structure factors  
are directly proportional to the DOS.(cite)
The intensity for the dynamic structure factor of transverse 
polarizations has been found to be four to five\cite{taraskin_phonons_1997} 
and 6-8\cite{horbach_high_2001} times larger than longitudinal 
polarizations for a models 
of a-SiO2, which supports our finding that the DOS is dominated 
by transverse modes.

The observation that the acoustic modes are located on
top of a flat background for intermediate values of q has re-
cently been found by G ̈
otze and Mayr as an essential
result in their analytic calculation of the spectra within
mode-coupling theory.
\cite{gotze_evolution_2000}

The DOS predicted for a-SiO2 is similar to previous 
models\cite{taraskin_phonons_1997} as well as 
experimentally measured DOS.(cite)

The DOS predicted for jammed systems are similarly dominated by 
the transverse sound speed,\cite{vitelli_heat_2010} 
while results for disordered lattices demonstrate 
\cite{beltukov_ioffe-regel_2013,larkin_predicting_2013}

In the previous section, we examined the low-frequency DOS and found 
a Debye scaling is a good fit to the data.  From

By fitting the DOS 
from Fig. \ref{FIG:DOS} to Eq. \eqref{EQ:DOS_debye},
a sound speed is predicted. 
For both a-Si and a-SiO$_2$, the sound speeds predicted from the DOS 
are close to the transverse sound speeds predicted from the elastic 
constants and the structure factor.

The sound speeds predicted for a-Si in Table are in good agreement 
with those found in a previous study using a similar 
model.\cite{feldman_thermal_1993,feldman_numerical_1999} 

For a disordered solid, the three acoustic group 
velocities (two transverse and one 
longitudinal) can be predicted using the elastic constants
\cite{gale_general_2003} 
or by finite differencing of the three lowest frequency branches 
of the dispersion relation of the supercell.
\cite{feldman_thermal_1993,feldman_numerical_1999,
donadio_atomistic_2009,he_thermal_2011,
he_heat_2011,hori_phonon_2013,larkin_predicting_2013} 
Except for this low-frequency behavior, there is not an 
accepted method to predict the group velocity of a 
vibrational mode in a disordered system, although there have been 
attempts.
\cite{cahill_lattice_1988,duda_reducing_2011,donadio_atomistic_2009,
he_heat_2011,he_thermal_2011} 
In the Cahill-Pohl (CP) model, for example, the group velocity of 
all disordered modes is the sound speed, $v_s$, which is also assumed  
for the HS model Eq. \eqref{EQ:M:k_AF,HS}.
\cite{cahill_lattice_1988} This assumption is not generally valid  
for any material.\cite{feldman_numerical_1999,duda_reducing_2011,
donadio_atomistic_2009,he_heat_2011,he_thermal_2011,larkin_predicting_2013}

The transverse and longitudinal sound speeds of a material can be related 
to the material's elastic constants, which determine the bulk ($G$) and 
shear ($K$) moduli.(cite) The transverse sound speed is given by(cite)  
\begin{equation}\label{EQ:vs_T_elas}
v_{s,T} = \frac{G}{\rho}^{1/2},
\end{equation}
and the longitudinal by
\begin{equation}\label{EQ:vs_L_elas}
v_{s,L} = \frac{4G + 3K}{3\rho}^{1/2}.
\end{equation}
We use the bulk and shear moduli defined in terms of the elastic 
constants according to the Voight convention.(cite) 
The sound speeds calculated from the 
elastic constants are reported in Table . It is clear that the DOS of 
our models for a-Si and a-SiO$_2$ are characterized by using the 
transverse sound speeds, rather than an averaging of the transverse 
and longitudinal which is commonly used,(cite)  
\begin{equation}\label{EQ:vs_avg}
v_{s} = \frac{2}{3}v_{s,L} + \frac{1}{3}v_{s,T}. 
\end{equation}
This is backed up by theoretical(cite) and experimental(cite) results. 

The sound speeds can also be estimated from the structure factor.(cite) 
Calculating the structure factors of the supercell Gamma   
modes is a method to test for their plane-wave 
character at a particular wave vector and 
polarization. 
\cite{allen_diffusons_1999,feldman_numerical_1999} 
The structure factor has been used to predict effective 
dispersion amorphous materials 
experimentally\cite{green_density_2011} 
and 
numerically.\cite{feldman_numerical_1999,volz_molecular-dynamics_2000} 
The structure factor at a wave vector 
$\pmb{\kappa}$ is defined as\cite{allen_diffusons_1999} 
\begin{equation}\label{EQ:SLT}
S^{L,T}\kw = 
\sum_{\nu} E^{L,T}\kv
\delta (\omega-\omega\kgv),
\end{equation}
where the summation is over the Gamma modes, $E^{T}$ refers 
to the transverse polarization and is defined as
\begin{equation}\label{EQ:EL}
E^L\kv = 
\left|
\sum_{b} 
\hat{\pmb{\kappa}} \cdot e\kgvba 
\EXP{i\pmb{\kappa}\cdot\pmb{r}_0\ab{l=0}{b}} 
\right|^2
\end{equation}
and $E^{L}$ refers to the longitudinal polarization and is defined as
\begin{equation}\label{EQ:ET}
E^T\kv = 
\left|
\sum_{b} 
\hat{\pmb{\kappa}} \times e\kgvba 
\EXP{i\pmb{\kappa}\cdot\pmb{r}_0\ab{l=0}{b}} 
\right|^2.
\end{equation}
In Eqs. \eqref{EQ:EL} and \eqref{EQ:ET}, the $b$ summations are 
over the atoms in the disordered supercell, 
$\pmb{r}_0\ab{l=0}{b}$ refers to the equilibrium atomic position of 
atom $b$ in the supercell, $l$ labels the unit cells 
($l=0$ for the supercell), 
$\alpha$ labels the Cartesian coordinates, and 
$\hat{\pmb{\kappa}}$ is a unit vector.  
Explicit disorder is included in the Gamma frequencies 
$\omega\kgv$ and the $3N_a$ components of the eigenvectors, $e\kgvba$.

The structure factors $S^{L,T}(\kappa,\omega)$ are plotted in Fig. 
\ref{FIG:disp} for 
a-SiO$_2$ and a-Si (left and right panels) for wavevectors along the 
[100] direction of the 
supercells. The length scale used for the wavevectors, $\kappa = 2\pi/a[100]$,
are $a = $ 4.8 and 5.43 $\AA$ for a-SiO$_2$ and a-Si, which are based 
on the lattice constants of c-SiO2 and c-Si.(cite) 
Frequencies $\omega_0(\kappa)$ and lifetimes $\Gamma(\kappa)$ are predicted 
by fitting each structure 
factor peak $S^{L,T}\kw$ to a Lorentzian function
\begin{equation}\label{EQ:Lorentzian_SLT}
\begin{split}
S^{L,T}\kw = 
\frac{C_0(\pmb{\kappa})}{[\omega_0(\pmb{\kappa})-\omega]^2+\Gamma^2(\pmb{\kappa})},
\end{split}
\end{equation}
where $C_0(\nu)$ is a constant related to the DOS.
\cite{beltukov_ioffe-regel_2013} A dispersion relation is identified by 
plotting $\omega_0(\kappa)$ in the middle panel of Fig.\ref{FIG:disp}, 
where the error bars 
indicate the peak widths $\Gamma(\kappa)$. 

For a-Si, the peaks are reasonably Lorentzian for all wavenumbers considered.
\cite{feldman_calculations_2002} 
For a-SiO2, the peaks are well-approximated as Lorentzian only at the 
smallest wavenumbers. For 
large wavenumber, the structure factors peaks are much less than an order 
of magnitude larger than the background, and the widths are on the order 
of the frequency range considered in Fig. \ref{FIG:disp}.(cite) 
The structure factor gives the frequency spectrum
needed to construct a (nonstationary) propagating state with a
pure wave vector Q and pure longitudinal or transverse polarization
 \cite{feldman_thermal_1993}. Only low-frequency vibrations 
have an (approximate) wavevector in disordered systems, and there is 
no theorem guaranteeing this. \cite{feldman_numerical_1999}
While the structure factor gives the frequency spectrum needed to 
construct a propagating state with pure wavevector $\pmb{\kappa}$, 
the mode spectrum $E^{T,L}\kv$ (Eqs. and ) predicts the plane-wave 
character of each mode.(cite) As shown previously, it is not possible 
in general 
to assign a unique wavevector to individual modes, even at low frequency,
\cite{biswas_vibrational_1988,feldman_thermal_1993,silbert_normal_2009} 
which makes predicting individual mode group velocities challenging. 
Attempts have been made to predict individual mode group velocities, but 
it is not clear that these methods are consistent with the predictions 
made by the structure factor, in this work and in others.(cite)

Fig 4 shows the dispersion extracted by locating the peaks in 
the structure factor for a-SiO2 and a-Si. For a-Si, the dispersion is 
nearly linear at small $\kappa$ with slight negative dispersion at 
high $\kappa$.(cite) For a-SiO2, the dispersion is negative for even 
the smallest wavenumbers considered, transitioning to a strong positive 
dispersion at intermediate wavenumber. 
For intermediate $\kappa$ the longitudinal dispersion for a-SiO$_2$ 
more closely resembles 
the so-called ''dispersion law for diffusons``, where $\omega \propto q^2$.
\cite{beltukov_ioffe-regel_2013} This large positive dispersion has been 
observed in various amorphous models\cite{feldman_calculations_2002} 
including of a-SiO2.\cite{ruzicka_evidence_2004}

Sound speeds are estimated from the structure factor peaks by finite differencing, 
\begin{equation}\label{EQ:vs_dwdk}
v_{s} = \frac{ \delta \omega_0(\kappa)}{\delta \kappa}.
\end{equation}
Estimates of the sound speeds are found from using finite difference 
of the peaks in $S_{T,L}$ are shown in Table using the lowest frequency peaks 
from Fig. \ref{FIG:disp}. 
The values  obtained from the elastic constants  
are somewhat larger, an indication of the negative dispersion seen at low 
$wavenumber$, particularly for a-SiO2. It is clear that negative dispersion
also affects the low-frequency DOS, where the predicted sound speed 
$v_{s,DOS}$ is less than that predicted from the structure factor, which 
is less than that predicted from the elastic constants (Table ). 
The transverse sound speed predicted by the DOS $v_{s,DOS}$ is used for both 
a-SiO$_2$ and a-Si throughout the rest of this work.

BEGINALAN

We now predict the lifetimes of all vibrational modes in our 
models of a-SiO2 and a-Si to compare with lifetimes predicted from 
the structure factor (Eq. \eqref{EQ:Lorentzian_SLT}). 
We use the MD simulation-based 
normal mode decomposition (NMD) method to predict the lifetimes of each 
vibrational mode in the disordered supercell for our models 
of a-SiO2 and a-Si.
\cite{ladd_lattice_1986,mcgaughey_quantitative_2004,
turney_predicting_2009-1,larkin_comparison_2012} 
The NMD method can predict vibrational lifetimes which are affected by 
the disorder in the supercell.(cite) 

In NMD, the 
atomic trajectories from MD simulations are first mapped onto the vibrational 
mode coordinate time derivative,
\cite{dove_introduction_1993}
\begin{equation}\label{EQ:qdot}
\begin{split}
\dot{q}\kgvt{}{}{}=&\SUM{0}{}\sqrt{\frac{m_b}{N}}\dot{u}_{\alpha}
\lbt e^*\kgvba\EXP{i(\pmb{0}\cdot\mathbf{r}_0\ab{l}{0}}.
\end{split}
\end{equation}
Here, $m_b$ is the mass of the $b_{th}$ atom in the unit cell, 
$u_{\alpha}$ is the $\alpha$-component of the atomic displacement 
from equilibrium, $\dot{u}_{\alpha}$ is the $\alpha$-component 
of the atomic velocity, and $t$ is time.    
The spectral energy of each vibrational mode, $\Phi\kvt$, is calculated 
from 
\begin{equation}\label{A:E:Phi_NMD}
\begin{split}
\Phi(\nu,\omega) = 
\lim_{\tau_0\rightarrow\infty}\frac{1}{2\tau_0}
\left|\frac{1}{\sqrt{2\pi}}\int_{0}^{\tau_0}\dot{q}\kgvt
\exp(-i\omega t)dt\right|^2.
\end{split}
\end{equation}

The vibrational mode frequency and lifetime is predicted by fitting each mode's 
spectral energy $\Phi(\nu,\omega)$ (see Appendix ) to a Lorentzian function
\begin{equation}\label{EQ:Lorentzian_NMD}
\begin{split}
\Phi(\nu,\omega) = 
\frac{C_0(\nu)}{[\omega_0(\nu)-\omega]^2+\Gamma^2(\nu)},
\end{split}
\end{equation}
where the constant $C_0(\nu)$ is related to the average energy of 
each mode and the linewidth $\Gamma(\nu)$.
\cite{larkin_comparison_2012} The mode lifetime is given by(cite) 
\begin{equation}\label{EQ:NMD_life}
\begin{split}
\tau(\nu) = \frac{1}{2\Gamma(\nu)}
\end{split}
\end{equation}

The NMD-predicted lifetimes are plotted in Fig. \ref{FIG:Lifetimes} 
for a-SiO2 and a-Si. 
For both a-SiO2, the mode lifetimes are generally larger than 
the IR limit $\tau = 2\pi/\omega$,(cite) and follow 
this limit at low frequency. There is no clear evidence for a
quadratic scaling $\tau\propto\omega^{-2}$, which 
corresponds to a quadratic scaling of the diffusivity at low 
frequency where the group velocity is constant 
(Eq. \eqref{EQ:Dtau}). 
At high frequency the mode lifetimes are roughly constant 
without definite scaling. There is a peak near 
2 $10^{14}$ rads$/$s which corresponds to a peak in the DOS 
(see Fig. \ref{FIG:DOS}).  The lifetimes predicted from the 
structure factor fall below the NMD-predicted lifetimes 
and the IR limit. This is because the structure factor for 
a-SiO2 is evaluated for large enough wavenumber that the 
peaks are not well-approximated as Lorentzian.(cite) Fitting 
the peaks we find the linewidth (inverse lifetime) 
to be on the order of the frequency range considered in 
Fig. \ref{FIG:disp}. 
Models(cite) and theoretical(cite) predictions show that the 
structure factor begins to take on the form of the DOS 
for large enough wavenumber.
\cite{martin-mayor_dynamical_2001,baldi_thermal_2008} 

For a-SiO2 the NMD and 
structure factor-predicted lifetimes indicate that the low-frequency modes 
in our model are not well-characterized as propagating.(cite)  
For a-Si, 
The mode lifetimes show a clear scaling at low frequency 
$\tau\propto\omega^{-2}$. The lifetimes plateau at higher frequencies,
over a wider range of frequencies than a-SiO2, with two peaks 
corresponding to peaks in the DOS (Fig. \ref{FIG:DOS}). The plateau of 
lifetimes at high frequencies has been 
reported for disordered lattices
\cite{sheng_heat_1991,larkin_predicting_2013} and 
other models of a-Si.\cite{he_heat_2011} 
The transition from the quadratic low-frequency scaling to 
the plateau region occurs near 
1 $10^{14}$ rads$/$s, which corresponds to where the DOS peaks in Fig. 
\ref{FIG:DOS}. 
Similar behavior was observed for models of disordered lattices.
\cite{larkin_predicting_2013} The lifetimes predicted by the 
structure factor are in good agreement with those predicted by NMD 
at low frequencies. Similar agreement has been reported in other 
models of topologically disordered materials.
\cite{mazzacurati_low-frequency_1996} 
The longitudinal and transverse polarizations 
outline the scatter in the NMD-predicted lifetimes. While the DOS is 
dominated by transverse modes, the NMD and 
structure factor-predicted lifetimes indicate there 
is some mixture of longitudinal and transverse-like modes at 
low frequencies.(cite) Using the transverse sound speeds predicted 
from the DOS $v_{s,DOS}$ (Table ), the NMD-predicted lifetimes are 
used to predict the mode diffusivities in the next section.

The NMD-predicted lifetimes in this work are similar in magnitude to 
those predicted for previous models of a-Si. 
Fabian finds lifetimes on the order of picoseconds for a-Si and 
para-crystalline silicon.
\cite{fabian_anharmonic_1996,fabian_numerical_2003}
A previous study of Tersoff a-Si predicted vibrational lifetimes on 
the order of 100 ps, about ten times the values reported here and in 
other studies.(cite) It is unclear what the source of this 
discrepancy is.  Using the Tersoff potential on the WWW models in this 
work we find...Predicted lifetimes are also similar for 
samples created using a melt-quench technique 
(see Section \ref{S:Sample:Si}).

ENDALAN


A numerical investigation of Bickham\cite{bickham_numerical_1999} 
indeed shows that a strong perturbation of the vibrational
spectrum of a-Si can relax on a 100 ps time scale, compared
to 10 ps for a weak perturbation.\cite{bickham_calculation_1998} 
 
The lifetimes found by this method
are in good agreement with the perturbative calculations of
Fabian and Allen and are on the order of 10 ps at low tem-
peratures in both 216 and 4096 atom supercells.
\cite{bickham_calculation_1998}

Our results indicate that all of
these processes occur on a much faster time scale than the
ϳ1 ns temporal resultion of the Raman experiments, so it is
not obvious that the measured relaxation rates should be
identified with vibrational lifetimes.
\cite{bickham_numerical_1999}

\subsection{\label{S:Diffusivities}Diffusivities}
%--------------------------------------------------------------------------

BEGINALAN

Based on the lifetimes predicted from NMD, the diffusivities 
$D_{NMD}$ predicted 
at low frequency for a-Si follow very closely the scaling 
$D(\omega) \propto \omega^{-2}$ (Fig. \ref{FIG:diffusivities}). 
Rayleigh 
scattering due to point defects predicts $D \propto \omega^{-4}$, 
but is not observed in the amorphous systems studied in this work.(cite) 
While quartic scaling has been 
observed in harmonic studies of the diffusivities of modes in 
disordered lattices and jammed systems,
\cite{sheng_heat_1991,xu_energy_2009,vitelli_heat_2010} 
it has been demonstrated that the harmonic disorder in a-Si 
produces a scaling similar to Umklapp scattering.
\cite{feldman_thermal_1993}

The mode diffusivities show much 
less 
scatter than those predicted by the AF theory $D_{AF}$, which is due to 
the finite-size system and the broadening which is required to evaluate 
Eq. \eqref{EQ:DAF}.\cite{feldman_thermal_1993} By using a much larger 
broadening ($~100\delta\omega_{avg}$) the scatter in the AF-predicted 
diffusivities at low frequency can be smoothed, but at the cost of 
decreasing the diffusivities at intermediate and high frequencies. 
It is possible that a frequency-dependent broadening may be necessary 
for a-Si, 
but determining this dependence is not clear nor necessary for 
interpreting the results in this work. 

Both a-SiO$_2$ and a-Si have a region at higher frequencies where the 
AF-predicted mode diffusivities are relatively constant. This behavior 
has been reported for a number of model disordered systems such as 
disordered lattices
\cite{sheng_heat_1991,beltukov_ioffe-regel_2013,larkin_predicting_2013}, 
amorphous solids,(cite) and jammed systems.(cite) At the highest 
frequencies the AF-predicted 
diffusivities trend exponentially to zero, which is an indication 
that these modes are ''locons``, spatially localized modes which 
do not contribute to thermal conductivity.
\cite{allen_diffusons_1999,garber_numerical_2001} 

For a-SiO2, we find the same $\omega_{cut} = 4.55$ rad$/$s as used in 
Ref \citenum{baldi_thermal_2008} and a quadratic scaling 
gives a reasonably good fit 
to the low-frequency diffusivities predicted by the AF theory 
(Fig. \ref{FIG:diffusivities}). 
In this work, the predicted contribution $k_{ph} =0.10$ W/m-K is 
close to that predicted by Ref. \citenum{baldi_thermal_2008}. Within 
the errors of the predictions, the predicted $k_{ph}$ for a-SiO2 
is not significant, contributing about $5\%$ to $k_{vib}$. 

Because the AF-predicted diffusivities show a large scatter 
for a-Si at low-frequencies, both 
$\omega^{-2}$ and $\omega{-4}$ scalings can be considered as 
''fits`` to the low-frequency behavior. Both FKAW  
experimental results by Cahill et al. have used $\omega^{-4}$ scaling 
at low frequency.

Using the NMD-predicted lifetimes and AF-predicted diffusivities, a 
representative velocity can be computed, 
\begin{equation}\label{EQ:vAF}
\begin{split}
v_{AF}(\omega) = \left(3\frac{D_{AF,i}(\omega)}{\tau(\omega)}\right)^{1/2},
\end{split}
\end{equation}
and is shown in the inset of Fig. \ref{FIG:mfp}. 
For a-Si, $v_{AF}$ follows a 
decreasing trend with increasing frequency, similar to the trend 
for group velocities in a simple monatomic crystal.(cite) 

The dependence of $v_{AF}$ in frequency is similar to that found for 
simple crystalline systems, where negative dispersion typically 
causes a decrease of group velocity with increasing frequency (or 
wavevector).(cite) Negative dispersion has been predicted by many 
models of both a-SiO2 and a-Si,\cite{ruocco_relaxation_2000} 
as have experimental measurement of 
dispersion relations.(cite) The effective group velocities 
which have been predicted using dispersion relations near zero 
wavevector for large supercells of amorphous\cite{he_thermal_2011,he_heat_2011} 
and disordered lattices\cite{hori_phonon_2013} would appear to 
be underestimates 
compared with the effective velocities $v_{AF}$ predicted in this work, 
where $v_{AF}$ is within a factor of three of $v_s$ for all but the 
highest frequency, localized modes.(cite) Our predictions for 
$v_{AF}$ also support the notion of a minimum thermal diffusivity 
on the order of $D_{HS}$ for all vibrational modes except   
those which are localized (the so-called ''locons'').(cite) 

ENDALAN

This 
choice of $\omega_{cut}$ is motivated by the AF predictions, gives a 
reasonable fit to the NMD predictions, and also an extrapolated total 
thermal conductivity $k_{vib}$ which is in reasonably good agreement 
with $k_{GK}$ (Fig. \ref{FIG:cond}). 

Based on the NMD-predicted diffusivities, the modes at low frequency are 
dominated by transverse modes. However, given the scatter in the 
NMD-predicted lifetimes, there is some mixture of 
transverse and longitudinal 
modes at low frequency.  Treating these two branches separately 
is not necessary since similar results are obtained by assuming a single 
branch scaling $D(\omega)=B\omega^{-2}$ which is fit to coincide with the 
peak in diffusivity $D_{AF}$ at $\omega_{cut} = $ 11.6 E 12 rads/s. This 
choice of $\omega_{cut}$ is close to that used by 
FAB ($\omega_{cut}$ = 9.65 E 12 rads/s),\cite{feldman_thermal_1993} 
and is somewhat smaller than 
that used by FKAW\cite{feldman_numerical_1999} 
and Cahill et al.\cite{cahill_thermal_1994} 
($\omega_{cut}$ = 15.2 E 12 rads/s). 

The lifetimes predicted by NMD and scaled by the sound speed 
diverge from the AF predicted mode diffusivities when the mode 
lifetimes approach the IR limit, shown in 
Fig. \ref{FIG:Lifetimes}. This is an indication that the modes 
have transitioned 
from propagating (where the diffusivity $D$ and lifetime are 
related by $D = (1/3)v^2_s\tau$) to non-propagating where 
$D$ and $\tau$ need not be related.
\cite{allen_thermal_1993,feldman_thermal_1993,feldman_numerical_1999,
allen_evolution_1998}

which generally agree with diffusivities computed according to the 
formula of Edwards and Thoules.\cite{edwards_numerical_1972,
feldman_numerical_1999,beltukov_ioffe-regel_2013}

Thermal diffusivity has been predicted using a wave-packet method

It was shown 

Garber shows that these high-frequency modes are localized in the 
Anderson sense, showing exponential decay of the mode eigenvector.
\cite{garber_numerical_2001}

It was shown that the diffusivity $D_{AF}(\omega) \propto DOS(\omega)$ 
at low frequency when the modes are spatially uncorrelated and the 
overlap between them is small and independent of the frequency.
\cite{vitelli_heat_2010,xu_energy_2009} This result helps to explain 
the plateau of diffusivity for both a-SiO2 and a-Si at higher 
frequencies. The features in $D_{AF,i}$ for both a-SiO2 and a-Si can 
be explained by peaks in the DOS at these frequencies.

\subsection{\label{S:Bulk}Bulk}

BEGINALAN

To predict the bulk thermal conductivity for our models of a-SiO2 and 
a-Si, we use Eq. \eqref{EQ:kvib} 
and the GK method.(cite) The GK method for predicting 
thermal conductivity
is relatively inexpensive compared to the NMD and AF methods so  
large system sizes can be studied (see Section \ref{S:Sample:Si}).  
Similarly large 
systems were studied in Ref. \citenum{he_heat_2011}. The details of the 
GK method are discussed in Section \ref{S:Simulation}. 

The GK-predicted thermal conductivity $k_{GK}$ is plotted in 
Fig. \ref{FIG:cond} for 
varying system sizes $L$. For a-SiO2, there is no apparent dependence 
of $k_{GK}$ on $L$. For a-Si, there is a clear dependence of $k_{GK}$ on 
$L$. Assuming the DOS has the form of Eq. \eqref{EQ:DOS_debye} 
and the diffusivity scaling 
is quadratic (Eq. \eqref{EQ:Dw2}) 
for the low-frequency modes in the system, 
the thermal conductivity as a function of the system size 
takes the form
\begin{equation}\label{EQ:k0}
\frac{k(L)}{k_{bulk}} = 1 - \frac{c_0}{L},
\end{equation}
where $k_{bulk}$ is the extrapolated bulk thermal conductivity and $c_0$ 
is a constant. The extrapolation is performed using the three largest 
system sizes studied, including the tiled 800,000 atom sample (see 
Section \ref{S:Sample:Si}). 
We do not observe that tiling an a-Si model increases 
the thermal 
conductivity of a given system size above that predicted by Eq. , as 
was found in Ref \citenum{he_thermal_2011}. This is likely due to the 
small (512 atom) model used to perform the tiling in that study, 
while we use a 100,000 atom model. 
The success of 
Eq. \eqref{EQ:k0} for the dependence of $k_{GK}$ on 
$L$ for our model is in 
agreement with the quadratic scaling of the 
diffusivity for a-Si shown in Fig. \ref{FIG:diffusivities} 
and the Debye-scaling of the DOS in Fig. \ref{FIG:DOS}. 

To predict $k_{vib}$ we choose $\omega_{cut}$, 
the constant $B$ for the diffusivity scaling, and the sound speed 
$v_{s}$. For both a-SiO2 and a-Si, we use the sound speeds predicted 
by a fit to the low-frequency DOS (Fig. \ref{FIG:DOS}). 
For a-Si, the constant $B$ for the quadratic scaling is chosen such 
that $D(\omega) = D_{AF,i}$ for $\omega_i=1.16$ rad$/$s. This value 
of $\omega_{cut}$ is somewhat smaller than that used in Ref and . 
The constant $B$ we find is somewhat larger than that found in 
Ref. and . We choose this $\omega$ because of the reasonable agreement 
between the AF-predicted $D_{AF}$ and NMD-predicted $D_{NMD}$ in this 
frequency region, shown in Fig. \ref{FIG:diffusivities}. 
We predict for a-Si $k_{ph} = 0.62$ 
W$/$m-K. Similar values for $k_{ph}$ can be predicted by increasing 
$\omega_{cut}$ and decreasing $B$. 

For a-Si a quadratic scaling is also 
considered using $\omega_{cut}$ from the study by . As there is no clear 
evidence of a quartic scaling of diffusivity, we choose the constant 
$B$ to pass visibly through both $D_{AF}$ and $D_{NMD}$ in 
Fig. \ref{FIG:diffusivities} because there is no clear procedure 
to perform a fit. Our choice of $B=9.0 10^{46}$ m$^@$/s (rads$/$s)^4 
for the quartic scaling is nearly the same as a fit\cite{cahill_lower_1994} 
to the diffusivities in Ref \citenum{feldman_thermal_1993}, 
$B=1.23 10^{47}$ m$^@$/s (rads$/$s)^4. 
When using the quartic diffusivity scaling $D(\omega)\propto\omega^{-4}$, 
the thermal conductivity is divergent as the frequency goes to zero.
(cite) The thermal conductivity can be made finite using a boundary 
scattering models,(cite) such as the simple one considered in 
Section \ref{S:Bulk}. 
While a fit to our model is not possible for the quartic scaling, 
it has been used to explain previous experimental measurements of 
a-Si thin films.(cite)

Baldi et al used a $\omega_{cut}=$ $4.55$ rads$/$s, which is a 
reasonable 
cut-off for our model of a-Si.\cite{baldi_thermal_2008} 
Baldi et al find that the contribution $k_{ph}~0.1$ W/m-K, which is 
the same as the contribution $k_{ph}$ predicted in this work for 
a-SiO2. This contribution 
$k_{ph}$ is smaller than the error bars in the predictions of $k_{vib}$ 
and $k_{GK}$ shown in Figs. and .  

The quadratic scaling of mode diffusivities at low frequencies 
for a-Si 
is responsible for the system size dependent thermal conductivity 
predicted by the GK method $k_{GK}$. 
While our model is best described by 
quadratic scaling, we are modeling bulk a-Si. 
 
ENDALAN 

Comparing with previous MD simulations of a-Si, 
Lee found a value of around 1 W/m-K 
but with very small supercell sizes.\cite{lee_molecular-dynamics_1991}
He et al find for bulk a-Si $k_{vib} = 3$ W/m-K using the Tersoff 
potential and a linear extrapolation of the form Eq. using 
non-equillibrium molecular dynamics. 

For smaller system sizes, the same trajectories are used for the GK and 
NMD methods. The MD simulations were run with the same parameters 
as the NMD method (see Section ). 

The predicted thermal condcutivties from the GK method are plotted 
in Fig. . For a-SiO2, the thermal conductivity is size independent 
within the errors.  For a-Si, there is a clear size-dependance of the 
thermal conductivity

To compare the results of the mode-based methods (NMD and AF) and 
the GK method, it is necessary to estimate the missing contribution from 
vibrational modes with frequency less than the minimum frequency of 
the finnite systems. 



``We find that we cannot define a wave vector for the
majority of the states, but the intrinsic harmonic diffusivity is still well-defined and has a numerical value
similar to what one gets by using the Boltzmann result, replacing v by a sound velocity and replacing l by
an interatomic distance a.
''\cite{feldman_thermal_1993}

``In order to fit the experimental sc( T) it is necessary to add a Debye-
like continuation from 10 meV down to 0 meV. The harmonic diffusivity becomes a Rayleigh m
law
and gives a divergent ~(T) as T~O. To eliminate this we make the standard assumption of resonant-
plus-relaxational absorption from two-level systems (this is an anharmonic effect which would lie outside
our model even if it did contain two-level systems implicitly).
''\cite{feldman_thermal_1993}

The same $\omega_{cut}$ was used by Cahill et al. 
together with a Rayleigh scaling and a boundary scattering model to 
find $k_{ph} = 0.31$ W/m-K.\cite{cahill_thermal_1994} 


The relative contribution of $k_{ph}$ and $k_{AF}$ is also predicted to 
be similar for silicon nanowires.\cite{donadio_atomistic_2009} 

The comparison between theory and experi-
ment supports the description
of heat transport in disordered materials developed in
Ref. 10, namely, that the dominant heat transport mech-
anism is coupling between nearly degenerate, extended,
but nonpropagating vibrational modes.

BEGINALAN

The thermal conductivity accumulation function,
\begin{equation}\label{EQ:matth}
k(\Lambda_{cut}) = \frac{1}{V}\int^{\Lambda_{cut}}_{0} 
kb D(\Lambda)DOS(\Lambda)    
+ 
\frac{1}{V}\sum_{\Lambda{\AF} < \Lambda_{cut}} kb v_{AF}\Lambda_{AF},
\end{equation}
is predicted using our models of bulk a-SiO2 and a-Si and shown in Fig. . 
For the phonon contribution $k_{ph}$, the mode diffusivities 
$(D(\omega)$ can be transformed $D(\Lambda) = D(\omega)/v_s$. 
A simple boundary scattering based on the film thickness $t_f$ 
and the Matthiesen rule is used,\cite{sellan_cross-plane_2010{
\begin{equation}\label{EQ:LambdaMatth}
\begin{split}
\frac{1}{\Lambda_{eff}} = \frac{1}{\Lambda_{bulk}} + 
\frac{2}{t_f}.
\end{split}
\end{equation}
The effective MFP of the low-frequency, long MFP (large $D(\omega)$) 
modes are limited and the quartic scaling 
predicts a finite thermal conductivity. 

The thermal conductivity accumulation functions for 
a-SiO2 and a-Si thin films are shown in Fig. . 
The thermal conductivity accumulation function for a-SiO2 saturates 
at a MFP of 10 nm, which is on the order of the finite size 
of our model (Section \ref{S:Sample}). 
This sharp accumulation at small MFPs is 
in good agreement with the prediction that $k_{AF}$ is the dominant 
contribution to $k_{vib}$. This result is also in accord 
with the penetration depth-independent thermal 
conductivity measurements using broadband FDTR.
\cite{regner_broadband_2013} Only the quadratic scaling is 
considered for a-SiO2, which is discussed later in 
Section \ref{S:Accumulation}. 

For a-Si, the thermal conductivity accumulation function shows that 
$k_{AF}$ saturates before 10 nm, which is also on the order of our  
finite model size. The propagating contribution $k_{ph}$ is predicted 
using both quadratic and quartic scaling for the 
mode diffusivities. As discussed in Section \ref{S:Conductivity}, 
the quadratic scaling 
is responsible for the system size dependent thermal conductivity 
predicted by the GK method ($k_{GK}$, see 
Section \ref{S:Conductivity}) and seems to be 
the correct scaling to describe the low-frequency modes for our model 
of bulk a-Si. Using the quadratic scaling, the thermal accumulation 
functions for our model of a-Si thin films passes reasonably well 
through many of the experimentally measured values.(cite) The quartic 
scaling also passes through many of the experimentally measured 
values reasonably well, particularly for film thicknesses 
larger than 10 $\mu$m.(cite)

BEGINALAN

Previous experimental studies of a-SiO2 have estimated negligible 
the contribution from 
low frequency ($\omega<\pi 10^12 rads/s$)\cite{love_estimate_1990} 
vibrational modes to be negligible. Using our model of a-SiO2, we also 
find the 
low-frequency propagating contribution to be negligible 
(Section \ref{S:Accumulation}). 
While experiments show there is are 
cross-over regions from quadratic to quartic scaling of the mode 
lifetimes in a-SiO2, the thermal conductivity of thin film a-SiO2 shows 
no significant dependence on the thickness.(cite) 
The cross-over 
region from quadratic to quartic, then back to quadratic 
observed in experiments for  
a-SiO2 occurs in the frequency range $4.6 10^9$ to 
$1.52 10^{10}$ rads$/$s,\cite{masciovecchio_evidence_2006} 
and $3.04 10^11$ to 
$1.52 10^{12}$ rads$/$s
\cite{baldi_emergence_2013}. 
While these frequency ranges are inaccessible by our finite-
size models, we estimate that the extrapolated $k_{ph}$ using a quartic 
scaling in this region to be... 

The transverse sound speed predicted for our model of 
a-SiO2 is about $85\%$ of that measured by experiment.\cite{liu_high_2009}  
While using a smaller transverse sound speed 
leads to an underprediction of the 
mode diffusivity scalings (Eq. \eqref{EQ:Dtau},
Fig. \ref{FIG:diffusivities} ), it leads to an 
overprediction of the DOS (Eq. \eqref{EQ:DOS_debye}). 
Overall this leads to an underprediction 
of the thermal conductivity because the DOS scales as 
$DOS(\omega)\propto 1/v^3_{s}$. We can regard the predictions from 
our models, with smaller transverse sound speeds, 
as an upper bound on $k_{ph}$ for a given diffusivity scaling 
$D(\omega) = B\omega^{-2}$. 
The critical parameter is the choice of $\omega_{cut}$.(cite) 
We pick 
$\omega_{cut}$ and the low frequency scaling $D(\omega) = B\omega^{-2}$ 
based on their ability to describe the low-frequency behavior 
of the vibrational modes in our finite-size models. The quadratic scaling 
$D(\omega) = B\omega^{-2}$ has been observed in separate numerical studies 
for models of a-SiO2(cite) and a-Si(cite). 

The bulk thermal conductivity predicted for our model of a-SiO2 overestimates 
that of experimental measurements.\cite{regner_broadband_2013} This can be 
attributed to either difference between experimental a-SiO2 and the 
potential model used in this work,(cite) the lack of anharmonic scattering 
included in the AF theory,\cite{feldman_thermal_1993} or the assumption 
of the classical-limit specific heat for all frequencies 
(Section \ref{S:Theory}). Qualitatively, 
our model confirms that propagating modes do not contribute significantly 
to the thermal conductivity of a-SiO2.
 
The classical-limit mode specific heat is a good approximation 
for the low-frequency propagating modes in a-SiO2 and a-Si, which are shown to 
fully activated by around 10 K.(cite) 
The classic limit for the mode specific heat is 
an over-prediction for the high frequency modes in a-SiO2 and a-Si at 300 K.(cite) 
However, the contribution $k_{AF}$ we predict in the classical limit 
for mode specific heat for a-Si is nearly the same as the 
the non-propagating contribution (plateau) predicted by broadband FTDR.(cite) 
Adjusting the specific heats to include quantum statistical effects...
Taking the diffuson contribution $k_{AF}$ to be a constant, which we predict 
to be $k_{AF} \approx 1$ W$/$m-K in agreement with other numerical 
studies(cite) and experiments(cite), 
we can thus focus on determining the less understood 
low-frequency propagating 
contribution $k_{ph}$. 

The scaling of the low-frequency lifetimes 
in a-Si is not clear from the experimental measurement. 
For a-Si thin films, varying preparation techniques suggest either 
quadratic(cite) or quartic(cite) scaling. 
While there is no clear consensus from various experiments, all predictions in this 
work demonstrate that  
the low-frequency modes in bulk a-Si follow a quadratic scaling 
of the mode lifetimes, which has been observed in previous models of 
a-Si(cite) and 
a-SiO2.(cite)
Amorphous silicon, however, can be
prepared only in thin films,(cite) where voids and other 
inhomogeneities are unavoidable\cite{li_effect_2011} and can influence the 
vibrational structure at low frequencies.
\cite{feldman_tight-binding_2004,liu_high_2009} 
A smooth transition between quadratic and quartic scaling can be 
achieved using a phenomenological model where a cross-over wavevector 
(or frequency) must be specified by experiment.
\cite{baldi_elastic_2011} While this cross-over can be identified 
experimentally for a-SiO2,\cite{masciovecchio_evidence_2006} 
experiments are limited for a-Si thin films.(cite) Our models 
are not large enough to investigate the relevant frequency range 
($< 1 10^{12}$ rads$/$s),(cite) so we considered both 
quadratic and quartic lifetime scalings when predicting 
the thermal conductivity accumulation functions in Fig. . 
Experimental measurements of the cross-over frequency (wavevector) and 
steepness parameter are needed from experiment to investigate the 
applicability of this phenomenological model further.(cite) 
The dependence 
of a-Si thin film thermal conductivity on thickness,(cite) 
preparation method,(cite) 
and hydrogen content(cite) make this particularly challenging. In fact, 
different experimental studies can be satisfactorily explained using 
quadratic(cite) or quartic(cite) scalings 
found that each was a satisfactory explanation for the results found.
(cite) 

A number of emerging experimental techniques are capable of 
studying the low-frequency propagating modes in disordered systems.
(cite) For amorphous materials, where the propagating contribution $k_{ph}$ 
is typically smaller than in the crystalline phase, broadband FDTR has demonstrated 
it can probe the relatively small effect of propagating modes at 300 K.  
However, the broadband FDTR studies thus far have been limited to one 
deposition technique and a relatively small range of film thicknesses 
($500$ nm $<t_{f}<$ 2000 nm).(cite) 
The nature of the low frequency scaling can be better elucidated using  
broadband FDTR on films prepared using 
varying deposition techniques,(cite) 
a wider-range of film thicknesses (1-100 $\mu$m)
(cite) 
and lower-range of temperatures ($~10-100$ K).(cite)
For a-Si, propagating low-frequency have been identified 
qualitatively by 
both experimental measurements(cite) and numerical modeling.(cite) 
It is thus interesting to consider thin films of a-SiGe alloys, which have been 
demonstrated to have reduced thermal conductivities compared to a-Si.
\cite{feldman_thermal_1993} It is not clear what vibrational lifetime scaling 
at low frequency would be observed in a simple topologically disordered alloy 
given there is no a consensus for even topologically disordered but chemically 
ordered systems.(cite) A combination of frequency-domain, time-domain, and 
variable-physical-heating size measurements would be helpful in investigating.

This supports the idea of Slack for a-SiO$_2$\cite{slack_thermal_1979}
While the thermal conductivity of a-SiO , the material is characterized by 
a constant similar for other amorphous
materials such as Lennard-Jones argon\cite{larkin_predicting_2013} 
and a model of a-GeTe.\cite{sosso_thermal_2012}

That the amorphous phase
of Si should have a lower GHz attenuation than many other
amorphous materials is not entirely surprising, as the 2002
review of low-temperature thermal conductivity and internal
friction by Pohl, Liu, and Thompson certainly indicates that
the fourfold coordinated materials tend to demonstrate weaker
anharmonicity.\cite{pohl_low-temperature_2002}

Theoretical predictions of acoustic attenuation in amor-
phous solids generally agree that at room temperature, a
quadratic frequency dependence is expected in the frequency
range of 10 GHz–1 THz and its origins are expected to be
the anharmonicity of the interatomic bonds.

Theory from Schirmacher et al. predicted 
an w4 scaling below a system dependent onset frequency.

In this work we investigated the contributions of propagating $k_{ph}$ and 
non-propagating $k_{AF}$ modes to the total vibrational 
thermal conductivity $k_{vib}$ of two glasses, a-SiO2 and a-Si. 
For a-SiO2, the contribution from propagating modes $k_{ph}$ is shown to 
be negligible compared to $k_{vib}$. This is confirmed by various 
experimental measurements, including a broadband FDTR study which 
probed the vibrational MFPs or a-SiO2. The thermal conductivity 
accumulation function for our model of a-SiO2 saturates near a MFP of 
10 nm, in agreement with the results of Regner et al. who show no 
systematic variation of the thermal conductivity on $L_p$,
\cite{regner_broadband_2013} and in agreement with experiments on 
a-SiO2 thin films which show no systematic variation with film 
thickness $t_f$.(cite) 

Our model of bulk a-Si has a thermal conductivity $k_{vib}$ with 
significant contribution from $k_{ph}$, where the low-frequency 
propagating modes are best described by a quadratic scaling of the 
mode lifetimes. 
The thermal conductivity accumulation predicted for our model of bulk 
a-Si with a simple boundary scattering model show reasonable agreement 
with some of the experimentally predicted thermal conductivities 
using varying film thicknesses and deposition techniques (Fig. ).(cite) 
However, using a quartic scaling with our model also gives 
a satisfactory agreement with other experimental measurements (Fig. ).(cite) 
These large discrepancies between measured 
thermal conductivity of various a-Si thin films calls for the need of 
further experimentation. Broadband techniques,(cite) which have demonstrated 
the ability to probe a wide-range of vibrational mode 
frequencies and MFPs, can help elucidate.(cite)
