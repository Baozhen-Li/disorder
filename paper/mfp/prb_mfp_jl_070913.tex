\begin{abstract}

Understanding thermal transport in crystalline systems requires detailed 
knowledge of phonons, which are the quanta of energy associated with 
atomic 
vibrations. By definition, phonons are non-localized vibrations that 
propagate energy over distances much larger than the atomic spacing. For 
disordered materials (e.g., alloys, amorphous phases), with the 
exception 
of very long-wavelength (low-frequency) modes, the vibrational modes are 
non-propagating. The film thickness and temperature dependence 
of thermal conductivity measured by experiments show 
(indirectly) that propagating modes contribute 
significantly to thermal conductivity for a-Si but not a-SiO2. 
Recent measurements by Regner et al. using a 
broadband FDTR technique argue that these propagating vibrational 
mean free paths can 
be probed to measure the 
thermal conductivity accumulation function for a-SiO2 and a-Si.   
Using lattice dynamics calculations and molecular dynamics simulations 
on 
realistic models of a-SiO2 and a-Si, we predict and 
characterize the contributions from propagating and non-propagating 
vibrations 
to thermal conductivity. The vibrational mean free paths are 
predicted for a-SiO2 and a-Si and the thermal 
conductivity accumulation function is compared with experimental 
broadband FDTR and varying thin film thicknesses measurements. 
For a-SiO2, the propagating modes are found to contribute 
negligibly for both bulk and thin film a-SiO2. We demonstrate using 
(to our knowledge) the largest model of bulk a-Si the scaling 
of the low frequency mode thermal diffusivities.  
Comparison of our model with 
the widely-varying experimental measurements  
show that the scaling of low-frequency mode diffusivities in a-Si 
thin films are well-described by our model 
of bulk a-Si $\emph{and}$ a scaling based on point defects. Further  
experiments are needed to understand how the low-frequency scaling 
of mode diffusivity varies with a-Si thin film thicknesses 
and preparation technique and suggestions are given based on 
the results from this work.

BEGINALAN

Amorphous silicon (a-Si) and nanocrystalline silicon have applications 
in high-efficiency solar cells.(cite) 
Films and substrates made of a-SiO2 and a-Si have wide application in 
semiconductor and optoelectronic devices.
(cite) Understanding the thermal transport in these amorphous systems 
is critical to improving their performance. 
Thermal transport at scales comparable to phonon wave-
lengths and mean free paths (MFPs) is presently a topic of
considerable interest for both crystalline and amorphous materials.
\cite{cahill_nanoscale_2003,
yu_reduction_2010,hochbaum_enhanced_2008,pernot_precise_2010}
Recently, nanostructured materials
such as nanowires, superlattices, and composites with
strongly reduced thermal conductivities due to phonon
scattering at interfaces and boundaries.
\cite{hochbaum_enhanced_2008,pernot_precise_2010,
boukai_silicon_2008,poudel_high-thermoelectric_2008} Recently, 
experimental measurements of the thermal conductivity of amorphous 
materials such as a-Si and amorphous SiN demonstrate that 
propagating (phonon-like) mode contribute significantly to thermal 
transport.(cite) However, the contribution of propagating modes to 
thermal 
transport in these amorphous materials is still not well understood.
(cite)

Traditionally, empirical expressions and
simple models have been the only means
to estimate MFPs in crystalline\cite{holland_analysis_1963} 
and amorphous materials.(cite)   
Experimentally, inelastic neutron scattering has been
used to measure phonon lifetimes in materials,
but this technique is more suited for single crystal samples.
\cite{christianson_phonon_2008} 
An x-ray diffraction and thermoreflectance technique
can measure ballistic transport in some structures, but is 
not well-suited for amorphous thin films.
\cite{highland_ballistic-phonon_2007} 
Koh et al. proposed a time-domain thermal reflectance (TDTR) 
technique with variation of
modulation frequency to probe the low-frequency MFPs in 
crystals and alloys,
\cite{koh_frequency_2007} 
but this technique is limited by the modulation frequency 
and the theoretical understanding of the technique.
(cite JAP paper) 
Studies have also been performed using  
frequency-domain thermal reflectance (FDTR) techniques 
to probe the accumulation function for bulk 
crystalline materials.\cite{minnich_thermal_2011,yang_mean_2013} 
Broadband FDTR measurements by Regner argue that the thermal 
conductivity accumulation function for a-SiO2 and a-Si  
can be measured by varying the penetration depth of the 
experimental measurement.\cite{regner_broadband_2013}
However, understanding 
of the thermal conductivity accumulation function in amorphous 
materials is still not well understood.
\cite{feldman_thermal_1993,cahill_thermal_1994,
feldman_numerical_1999,liu_high_2009,yang_anomalously_2010,
he_thermal_2011}

Understanding the thermal conductivity accumulation function 
requires an understanding of the low-frequency propagating 
modes and the scaling of their MFPs with 
frequency.(cite) 
Experimental measurements of the thermal conductivity of
thin films of a-SiO2 and a-Si at varying temperatures 
gives indirect information about the low-frequency propagating 
modes.(cite) For a-SiO2, 
varying temperature 
and film thickness
\cite{lee_heat_1997,yamane_measurement_2002} 
measurements all suggest that the propagating modes 
contribute a negligible amount to thermal conductivity. 
However, the behavior of the low-frequency modes 
has only recently been understood by experimental 
measurements.
\cite{masciovecchio_evidence_2006,baldi_thermal_2008,
baldi_sound_2010,baldi_elastic_2011,baldi_emergence_2013} 
For a-Si the low-frequency behavior of the MFPs is less understood.
(cite) 
Temperature-varying(cite) and film thickness-varying measurements
\cite{pompe_thermal_1988,cahill_thermal_1989,hasselman_thermal_1989,
kuo_thermal_1992,feldman_thermal_1993,cahill_thermal_1994,
wada_thermal_1996,feldman_numerical_1999,
moon_thermal_2002,zink_thermal_2006,zink_excess_2006,liu_high_2009,
yang_anomalously_2010}
suggest multiple, different behavior of the low-frequency 
scaling of the mean free paths of vibrational modes in a-Si. 

In this work, we perform Molecular Dynamics (MD) simulations and 
Lattice Dynamics calculations on large, realistic atomistic models 
of bulk a-SiO2 and a-Si. Large MD 
simulations of models for bulk and thin-film a-SiO2 show that 
propagating modes 
do not make a significant contribution to thermal conductivity. 
This is confirmed by a ``bottom-up``, mode-by-mode analysis.  
We predict the thermal conductivity of bulk a-Si using (to our 
knowledge) the largest MD simulation for a model of a-Si.(cite) 
Scaling 
of thermal conductivity with system size indicates that the 
low-frequency propagating modes in bulk a-Si contribute significantly 
to thermal conductivity. 
A ''bottom-up`` analysis of a large a-Si model supports the evidence 
that propagating 
modes contribute to the thermal 
conductivity of a-Si in an amount similar to that predicted by 
other models of a-Si(cite) and experimental results.(cite) 
The results are used to 
understand the recent experimental measurements of Regner et al. 
using broadband FDTR with varying 
penetration depths $L_p$.\cite{regner_broadband_2013}

The spectrum of vibrational MFPs and the accumulated thermal conductivity
(cite) 
are predicted for a-SiO2 and a-Si. The thermal conductivity for our model 
of a-SiO2 explains the results of the experimental measurements 
of Regner et al, which show no measured dependence of the thermal 
conductivity on $L_p$,\cite{regner_broadband_2013} and experimental 
measurements of the thermal conductivity of thin films which 
show no dependence on film thickness.(cite) 
Using a simple boundary scattering model, the accumulated thermal 
conductivity of a-Si thin films are predicted from our model 
of bulk a-Si. The predicted accumulated thermal conductivity 
reproduces the experimentally measured penetration depth-dependent 
thermal conductivity qualitatively.(cite) We consider two different 
scalings of the low-frequency MFPs based on our atomistic models 
and show that each scaling passes reasonably well through the 
various experimental measurements.
\cite{liu_high_2009,yang_anomalously_2010} Further experimentation 
is suggested based on the predictions from our models, previous 
experiments,
(cite) 
and emerging broadband thermoreflectance techniques.

% which suggests that there may be three regimes in vitreous

% at different ranges of wavevector for different materials,
% and this could account for different dependences being
% observed between different materials; the w4 dependence in 
% lithium diborate,\cite{ruffle_observation_2003} and for 
% the intermediate value
% of exponent 2.54 found for the transverse polarization
% by Christie et al.\cite{christie_vibrational_2007} and others.
% 
% In conclusion we have shown that in a system without any
% periodic order such as a monatomic liquid, one observes in-
% elastic excitations that can be interpreted as the noncrystal-
% line counterpart of Umklapp peaks.\cite{scopigno_observation_2001} 
% 
% The goal of this work...
% 
% In this work, we consider two ``stiff glass'' amorphous systems:
% Structural relxation phenomena do not dominate the dynamics 
% of the.\cite{gotze_evolution_2000} 
% 
% For modeling the low frequency vibrational modes, two types of 
% scattering mechanisms are considered: (a) phonon-phonon 
% scattering (b) Rayleigh scattering.

% The goal of this work is to predict the MFP of vibrational modes in 
% disordered systems. Simple Lennard-Jones systems will be studied.  A 
% perfect LJ crystal are alloyed with a species of differing mass and 
% amorphous samples are prepared. Thermal transport will be studied to 
% quantify and characterize the ordered and 
% disordered contributions to lattice thermal conductivity. In particular, a 
% more rigorous way to classify vibrational modes in disordered alloys and 
% amorphous samples as phonon-like or diffuson will be investigated. These 
% results will be compared to the phenomenological Einstein and Cahill-Pohl 
% models,\cite{einstein1911,kittel1949,cahill1992}.

% hermal conductivity (k), which relates the heat flux (!
% q)
% and temperature gradient (rT) in a material through the
% Fourier law, !
% q 1⁄4 À krT, results from the cumulative
% contributions of phonons with a broad range of mean free paths
% (MFPs). The spectral MFP distribution is critical in nanostruc-
% tured materials and devices, where size effects selectively scatter
% phonons or create non-Fourier conduction based on individual
% phonon MFPs. Such effects have an impact on heat dissipation in
% nanoelectronics and photonics, as well as the design of
% nanostructured thermoelectric materials with reduced thermal
% conductivity1–9. Because of its ubiquity in electronics, crystalline
% silicon (c-Si) has emerged as the prototypical material of study,
% yet controversy persists on what phonon MFPs dominate thermal
% transport, even in the bulk material. Kinetic theory defines the
% thermal conductivity as k 1⁄4 Cvs LG =3, where C is the volumetric

\section{\label{S:Theory}Theoretical Formulation}
%--------------------------------------------------------------------------

%--------------------------------------------------------------------------
\subsection{\label{S:Theory:Thermal}Vibrational Thermal Conductivity}
%--------------------------------------------------------------------------

To calculate the total vibrational thermal conductivity $k_{vib}$ 
of amorphous solids, we predict 
the contributions from $k_{pr}$ and $k_{AF}$, 
\begin{equation}\label{EQ:kvib}
\begin{split}
k_{vib} = k_{pr} + k_{AF},
\end{split}
\end{equation}
where $k_{pr}$\cite{ashcroft_solid_1976,dove_introduction_1993,
ziman_electrons_2001} is the contribution from 
propagating (phonon-like) modes and $k_{AF}$ is the non-propagating 
contribution 
from the Allen-Feldman (AF) theory of diffusons.
\cite{feldman_thermal_1993} The form of Eq. \eqref{EQ:kvib}
has been used in 
several previous studies of amorphous materials with varying 
assumptions.\cite{feldman_thermal_1993,cahill_thermal_1994,
liu_high_2009,yang_anomalously_2010,feldman_numerical_1999,
baldi_thermal_2008,he_heat_2011} 
The various 
assumptions all lead to predictions that $k_{pr}$ is an negligible 
($< 10\%$) 
and non-negligible ($> 20\%$) fraction of $k_{vib}$ 
for 
a-SiO2(cite) and 
a-Si(cite), respectively.  

The contribution $k_{pr}$ is predicted using a Debye-like model,(cite) 
\begin{equation}\label{EQ:kph}
\begin{split}
k_{pr} = \frac{1}{V}\int_{0}^{\omega_{cut}} 
d\omega DOS(\omega) C(\omega) D_{pr}(\omega),
\end{split}
\end{equation}
where $V$ is the system volume, $\omega$ is the vibrational mode 
frequency, $DOS(\omega)$ is the vibrational 
density of states, $C(\omega)$ is the vibrational mode specific heat, 
and $\omega_{cut}$ is the propagating cut-off frequency, and 
$D_{pr}(\omega)$ is the propagating mode thermal diffusivity 
(see Eq. \eqref{EQ:Dtau}).(cite) 
The cut-off frequency $\omega_{cut}$ identifies the transition from 
propagating (phonon-like) to non-propagating (diffuson) modes 
(see Section \ref{S:Diffusivities}).
\cite{feldman_thermal_1993,cahill_thermal_1994,
feldman_numerical_1999,liu_high_2009,yang_anomalously_2010}
The propagating contribution $k_{pr}$ is written as an integral because 
the finite simulation sizes studied in this work (and others)
\cite{feldman_thermal_1993,feldman_numerical_1999}
limit the lowest 
frequency vibrational modes which can be studied and an extrapolation 
must be made to the zero frequency limit.(cite)  
Eq. \eqref{EQ:kph} can be obtained using the single-mode relaxation
time approximation to solve 
the Boltzmann transport equation for a phonon gas.
\cite{ziman_electrons_2001}. Assumed in Eq. \eqref{EQ:kph} 
are isotropy (valid for an amorphous material) and a single phonon 
polarization,(cite) making the  
properties a function of the mode frequency $\omega$ only. The 
choice of a single phonon polarization (i.e., an averaging 
of the transverse and longitudinal branches)(cite) does not 
significantly change 
the results predicted in this work, or others.
\cite{feldman_thermal_1993,cahill_thermal_1994,
feldman_numerical_1999,baldi_thermal_2008,liu_high_2009,
yang_anomalously_2010} 

Under the Debye approximation, 
which assumes isotropic and linear dispersion (i.e., $v_g = v_s$), 
the density of states, $DOS(\omega)$, is
\begin{equation}\label{EQ:DOS_debye}
DOS(\omega) = \frac{3\pi\omega^2}{2v_{s,DOS}^3},
\end{equation}
where $v_s$ is an appropriate sound speed.(cite) 
Since we use MD simulations, which are classical 
and obey Maxwell-Boltzmann 
statistics,\cite{mcquarrie_statistical_2000} we take the phonon and diffuson 
specific heat to be $C(\omega) = k_{\text{B}}$ in the 
harmonic limit. This harmonic approximation has been shown to be valid 
for a-Si modeled using the Stillinger-Weber potential at the temperatures of 
interest here for low-frequency modes.(cite) 
Taking the classical limit for the specific heat allows for a direct 
comparison between 
the MD- and lattice dynamics-based methods and is discussed further in
Section \ref{S:Bulk}. 

In a disordered system, only the diffusivity of the low-frequency 
propagating modes can be written as(cite)     
\begin{equation}\label{EQ:Dtau}
\begin{split}
D_{pr}(\omega) = \frac{1}{3}v^2_g(\omega)\tau(\omega),
\end{split}
\end{equation}
where the mode group velocity $v_g(\omega) = v_s$ and $\tau(\omega)$ is 
the mode lifetime.(cite)  
The physical picture is of propagating plane waves which 
travel with velocity $v_s$ for a time $\tau$ before scattering.
(cite) 
An equivalent physical picture in terms of a scattering length 
is
\begin{equation}\label{EQ:DLambda}
\begin{split}
D(\omega) = \frac{1}{3}v_g(\omega) \Lambda(\omega),
\end{split}
\end{equation}
where $\Lambda$ is the phonon mean free path (MFP), defined as 
\begin{equation}\label{EQ:Lambda}
\begin{split}
\Lambda(\omega) = v_{g}(\omega) \tau(\omega).
\end{split}
\end{equation}
In a disordered system, Eqs. and are only valid in the 
low-frequency, long-wavelength limit.(cite) 
Because Eq. \eqref{EQ:Dtau} is only valid at low frequencies, 
the mode diffusivity $D$ is the fundamental quantity for modes at all 
frequencies and is the focus of this work (see Section \ref{S:Diffusivities}).
(cite) 
The propagating thermal diffusivity is modeled using 
\begin{equation}\label{EQ:Dw2}
\begin{split}
D_{pr}(\omega) = B\omega^{-n}, 
\end{split}
\end{equation}
where $B$ and $n$ are constants.   
At low frequencies (long wavelengths), $v_g = v_s$ is a constant 
and the scaling of 
diffusivity with frequency comes from the lifetime, 
\begin{equation}\label{EQ:tauw2}
\begin{split}
\tau(\omega) = B_{\tau} \omega^{-n},
\end{split}
\end{equation}
where $B_{\tau} = B/v_s^2$. For amorphous materials, the scaling exponent $n$ 
has been found to be $2\ge n \le 4$,(cite) 
where $n=2$ corresponds to 
Umklapp scattering\cite{callaway_model_1959} and $n=4$ Rayleigh scattering 
from point defects in a crystal.\cite{klemens_scattering_1955}
The form of the $DOS(\omega)$ [Eq. \eqref{EQ:DOS_debye}] 
and $D(\omega)$ [Eq. \eqref{EQ:Dw2}] with $n\le2$  
ensures that the 
thermal conductivity Eq. \eqref{EQ:kph} is finite.(cite) The form for $D(\omega)$ 
[Eq. \eqref{EQ:Dw4}] with $n>2$ causes the thermal conductivity 
[Eq. \eqref{EQ:kph}] to diverge 
in the low-frequency limit as the system size is increased,(cite) 
which can be fixed using additional anharmonic scattering
\cite{feldman_thermal_1993,feldman_numerical_1999} or 
boundary scattering.\cite{cahill_lower_1994,liu_high_2009,yang_anomalously_2010}

For non-propagating modes in the AF diffuson theory, 
$D(\omega)$ cannot be written as Eq. \eqref{EQ:Dtau}.\cite{allen_thermal_1993}  
The diffuson contribution to thermal conductivity, $k_{AF}$, is
\cite{feldman_thermal_1993,feldman_numerical_1999}
\begin{equation}\label{EQ:kAF}
\begin{split}
k_{AF} = \frac{1}{V}\sum_{\omega_i>\omega_{cut}} C_i(\omega) D_{AF,i}(\omega), 
\end{split}
\end{equation}
where $\omega_i$ is the frequency of the $i$th diffuson mode, $C_i(\omega_i)$ 
is the diffuson specific heat, and $D_{AF,i}$ is the diffuson diffusivity.
Eq. \eqref{EQ:kAF} is written as a sum because there are enough high-frequency 
diffuson modes in the finite-size systems studied in this work (and others).
\cite{feldman_thermal_1993,feldman_numerical_1999} 
Written as an integral, Eq. \eqref{EQL:kAF} has the same form as 
Eq. \ref{EQ:kph}, which can be derived starting 
with the Kubo theory
\cite{flicker_lattice_1973,allen_thermal_1993,alam_lattice_2005,
baldi_thermal_2008,yang_anomalously_2010}  
and taking the limit 
of zero phonon self-energy.\cite{baldi_thermal_2008} 
The AF diffusivities are predicted by\cite{allen_thermal_1993} 
\begin{equation}\label{EQ:DAF}
\begin{split}
D_{AF,i} = \frac{\pi V^2}{\hbar^2\omega^2_i}\sum_{j\neq i}
|S_{ij}|^2 \delta(\omega_i - \omega_j)
\end{split}
\end{equation}
where $\hbar$ is Planck's constant, $S_{ij}$ is the heat current operator 
between vibrational modes $i$ and $j$, and $\delta$ is the Dirac delta 
function. The diffusivity of diffusons 
can be calculated from harmonic lattice dynamics theory.
\cite{allen_thermal_1993,feldman_thermal_1993,feldman_numerical_1999} 
The heat current operator $S_{ij}$ measures the thermal 
coupling between modes $i$ and $j$ based on their frequencies and 
spatial overlap of eigenvectors 
(see Section \ref{S:Structure} and \ref{S:Life}). 
For Eq. \eqref{EQ:DAF}, $S_{ij}$ is directionally averaged because 
the amorphous materials studied in this work are isotropic.(cite) 
The diffuson specific heat is taken to be $C_i(\omega) = k_{\text{B}}$ 
to remain consistent with the same assumption for low-frequency propagating 
modes and the MD- and LD-based methods compared in this work. 
The implication of this assumption is discussed in Section \ref{S:Bulk}.

While predictions for the contributions to the total 
vibrational thermal conductivity $k_{vib}$ from 
propagating ($k_{pr}$) and non-propagating ($k_{AF}$) have 
been made for a-SiO2 and a-Si,(cite) no thermal conductivity 
accumulation functions have been predicted to compare with Regner.
(cite) 
Using lattice dynamics calculations and molecular dynamics simulations 
of large-scale ($~4000$ atom models), 
we predict the inputs to Eq. \eqref{EQ:kvib} in Sections \ref{S:DOS}, 
\ref{S:Structure}, \ref{S:Diffusivities}, and the bulk thermal 
conductivity 
$k_{vib}$ and its contributions $k_{pr}$ and $k_{AF}$ in Section 
\ref{S:Bulk} 
Using very large-scale (up to $800,000$ atoms) 
MD simulations, we predict the thermal 
thermal conductivity $k_{vib}$ of bulk a-SiO2 and a-Si to compare with 
the predictions based on the mode-by-mode properties. 
For the first time, the MFPs of propagating modes in bulk 
a-SiO2 and a-Si are used with a boundary scattering model 
to predict the thermal conductivity accumulation, which is 
compared with experimental thin film measurements and broadband 
FDTR measurements of a-SiO2 and a-Si in Section \ref{S:Accumulation}.

%--------------------------------------------------------------------------
\subsection{\label{S:Limits}Thermal Conductivity and Diffusivity Limits}
%--------------------------------------------------------------------------

To understand the non-propagating contribution $k_{AF}$, it is useful 
to consider a high-scatter (HS) limit for the mode diffusivity,
\begin{equation}\label{EQ:D_HS}
D_{HS} = \frac{1}{3} v_s a,
\end{equation}
where it is assumed that all vibrational modes travel with the sound speed  
$v_s$ and scatter over a distance of the lattice constant $a$.
(cite) 
This diffusivity assumption leads to a high-scatter (HS) limit of 
thermal conductivity in the classical limit\cite{cahill_lattice_1988} 
\begin{equation}\label{EQ:k_HS}
k_{HS} = \frac{k_{\text{B}}}{V_b}b v_s a,
\end{equation}
where $V_b$ is the volume of the unit cell and $b$ is the number of atoms 
in the unit cell.\cite{cahill_lower_1992} 
The advantage is that $k_{HS}$ is a simple 
functional form of the macroscopic material properties which can 
be evaluated with experimental measurements or modeling predictions. 
While Eqs. \eqref{EQ:D_HS} and \eqref{EQ:k_HS} are commonly used to 
establish a high-scatter limits for 
diffusivity and thermal conductivity, predictions for a-SiGe alloys 
\cite{feldman_thermal_1993} and experiments 
demonstrate that these are not true high-scatter limits.  
However, $k_{HS}$ is a good lower limit for the thermal conductivity 
of a-SiO2(cite) 
and a-Si,(cite) 
as well as other glasses.(cite)

It was demonstrated by Kittel that  
the thermal conductivity of glasses in the high-temperature limit could 
be interpreted 
using a temperature-independent high-scatter diffusivity on the order 
of Eq. \eqref{EQ:D_HS}.\cite{kittel_interpretation_1949}  
This corresponds to a propagating (phonon) model with MFP $\Lambda = a$, 
too small to justify use of the model. The success of Kittel's theory 
implies that the dominant 
modes in most glasses are diffusons and not phonons, and  
$k_{vib} \approx k_{HS}$.
\cite{kittel_interpretation_1949,graebner_phonon_1986}  
For example, amorphous Lennard-Jones argon is dominated 
by high-scatter modes,\cite{larkin_predicting_2013} as is a model of 
a-GeTe,\cite{sosso_thermal_2012} and both their $k_{vib} \approx k_{HS}$. 
For a-SiO$_2$, $k_{vib} \approx 2k_{HS}$, while it is unclear what the 
appropriate lattice constant $a$ should be, making a factor of 
2 reasonably uncertain.(cite) 
For a-Si, the experimentally measured thermal conductivity at 
300 K is $k_{vib} \approx (1-6) k_{HS}$,\cite{cahill_lower_1992}  
indicating that there may be a large contribution from $k_{pr}$. 
We investigate the contributions $k_{pr}$ and $k_{AF}$ using 
detailed atomistic models for a-SiO2 and a-Si which are 
described in the next section.

\section{\label{S:Calculation}Calculation Details}
%--------------------------------------------------------------------------

%--------------------------------------------------------------------------
\subsection{\label{S:Sample}Sample Preparation}
%--------------------------------------------------------------------------

The a-SiO$_2$ samples are used from Ref. \citenum{mcgaughey_thermal_2004} 
and have size $N_a =$ 288 , 576, and 972 where $N_a$ are the number of 
atoms in the supercell sample. These samples were 
originally prepared using a melt-quench procedure.(footnote) 
Using the same procedure, larger systems of 
$N_a = $ 2880, 4608, and 34,562 were created. The largest sample 
has $N_a = 34,562$ and supercell size $L=8.052$ nm. All samples were 
simulated at a density $\rho=2350$ kg/m$^3$.(cite) 
The atomic potential used 
for a-SiO$_2$ is the modified BKS potential from Ref. 
\citenum{mcgaughey_thermal_2004} except the 24-6 
Lennard-Jones (LJ) potential is changed to a 12-6, 
which has a negligible effect on the predictions presented in this paper. 
The LJ potentials use a cutoff of 8.5 $\AA$ and the Buckingham 
potential uses a cutoff of 10 $\AA$. 
The electrostatic interactions are handled using the Wolf method with 
exponential parameter $\eta=0.223 \AA^{-1}$ and a cutoff of 12 $\AA$.
\cite{gale_general_2003} 

For a-Si, we use models created by the 
modified Wooten-Winer-Weaire (WWW) algorithm 
from Ref. \citenum{barkema_high-quality_2000}.  Sample sizes 
with $N_a$ =  
216, 1000, 4096, and 100,000 were provided.    
A large sample was created from the $N_a = 100,000$ sample 
by treating it 
as a unit cell and tiling twice in all directions to create an 
$N_a = 800,000$ sample with supercell size $L=24.81$ nm. 
All a-Si structures used have $\rho=2330$ kg/m$^3$, 
equivalent to the perfect 
crystal with a lattice constant of $a=$5.43 $\AA$. 
The Stillinger-Weber potential is 
used for these a-Si samples.\cite{stillinger_computer_1985}   

Small samples of a-SiO2 and a-Si are shown in 
Fig. \ref{FIG:supercell}. 
Both a-SiO2 and a-Si samples were annealed at a temperature of 
1100 K for 10 ns to remove 
meta-stability.\cite{feldman_numerical_1999}  
Amorphous materials have many different atomic (potential energy) 
configurations with nearly equivalent energies.
\cite{feldman_numerical_1999,
durandurdu_<i>ab_2002,bernstein_structural_2006} 
The removal of meta-stability is demonstrated 
by a decrease of the sample's potential energy from the 
pre-annealed configuration. 
This meta-stability can 
cause errors when predicting vibrational lifetimes using Normal 
Mode Decomposition (NMD, see Section \ref{S:Life}).(cite) 

(footnote)
The entire melt-quench procedure is performed at constant volume.
\cite{mcgaughey_thermal_2004} 
Crystalline silica (c-SiO2) is first 
melted at a temperature of 10,000 K in a cubic simulation cell. 
The liquid is then quenched 
instantaneously to 300 K and annealed for 10 ns.

\subsection{\label{S:Simulation}Simulation Details}
%--------------------------------------------------------------------------

Molecular dynamics (MD) simulations are performed using the disordered 
a-SiO$_2$ and a-Si supercells described in 
Section \ref{S:Sample}. 
The MD simulations were performed using LAMMPS\cite{plimpton_fast_1995}  
with time steps of dt = 0.00905 (0.0005) ps for a-SiO$_2$(a-Si). 
Ten MD simulations with different initial conditions were run and 
the predictions from these simulations were ensemble averaged. 
All MD simulations are first equilibrated in a NVT (constant number 
of atoms, volume, and temperature) ensemble for $10^6$ 
time steps. Data are then collected from simulations
in the NVE (constant number of atoms, volume, and total
energy) ensemble 
for $2^{21}$ time steps and the atomic trajectories sampled 
ever $2^{8}$ time steps. 

The Green-Kubo (GK) method is used to predict the thermal 
conductivity $k_{GK}$ (see Section \ref{S:Bulk}) from MD simulations 
of the 
largest supercells of a-SiO2 and a-Si (see Section \ref{S:Sample}). The 
$k_{GK}$ is predicted by window averaging the integral of the heat current 
autocorrelation function (HCACF).(cite) 
For a-SiO$_2$ and s-Si, a 
interval of the the HCACF integral can be found which is constant 
within the statistical noise.(cite) Within the errors reported 
in Fig., the first-avalanche method predict the same value for  
$k_{GK}$.(cite)   
For $N_a=4,608 (4,096)$, the trajectories from the MD simulations 
used for the GK method are also used with the NMD method to predict 
the vibrational mode lifetimes for a-SiO2(a-Si) in 
Section \ref{S:Life}. 

For the amorphous supercells studied,
the only allowed wave vector is the gamma-point (i.e., $\pmb{\kappa}=0$),  
where $\pmb{\kappa}$ is the wavevector and there are $3N_a$ polarization 
branches labeled by $\nu$.(cite) 
Calculation of the 
vibrational modes at the Gamma point (referred to as Gamma modes) 
require the eigenvalue solution 
of a dynamical matrix of size 
$(3N_a)^2$ that scales as $[(3N_a)^2]^3$, limiting the system 
sizes that can be considered to $N_a = 4,608(4,096)$ for 
a-SiO$_2$(a-Si). 
The eigenvalue solution is required to predict the vibrational 
density of states (DOS) (Section \ref{S:DOS}), structure factors 
(Section \ref{S:Structure}), perform the NMD technique  
(see Section \ref{S:Life})  
and perform the AF calculations (see Section \ref{S:Diffusivities}). 
The frequencies and eigenvectors were computed using harmonic
lattice dynamics calculations and GULP.\cite{gale_general_2003} 
The calculation of the AF diffuson thermal diffusivities 
(Eq. \eqref{EQ:DAF}) 
is performed using GULP and a Lorentzian 
broadening of $14\delta\omega_{avg}$($5\delta\omega_{avg}$) for 
a-SiO$^2$(a-Si), where $\delta\omega_{avg}$ is the average mode 
frequency spacing ($\delta\omega_{avg} = ()$ for a-SiO2(a-Si)).
(cite) For a-Si the broadening used here is within 
$20\%$ of that used 
in Ref \citenum{feldman_numerical_1999}. 
Varying the broadening around these values does not 
change the resulting thermal conductivity $k_{AF}$ significantly 
(see Section \ref{S:Bulk}).

\section{\label{S:Vibrational}Vibrational Properties}
%--------------------------------------------------------------------------

%--------------------------------------------------------------------------
\subsection{\label{S:DOS}Density of States}
%--------------------------------------------------------------------------

In this section, we examine the vibrational frequencies and 
density of states (DOS) for our models of a-SiO$_2$ and a-Si. 
The vibrational DOS is computed by 
\begin{equation}\label{EQ:DOS}
DOS(\omega) = \sum_i \delta(\omega_i - \omega),
\end{equation}
where a unit step function is used to broaden 
$\delta(\omega_i - \omega)$.(cite)  
The DOS for a-SiO$_2$ and a-Si are plotted in Fig. \ref{FIG:DOS} 
using a broadening of $10\delta\omega_{avg}$ and $100\delta\omega_{avg}$.  
Because of the finite model size, the low-frequency modes are sparse and 
the DOS can depend on the broadening.
\cite{feldman_numerical_1999} We use a broadening which is large enough 
to obtain good statistics but also small enough to extend 
to low frequencies.  

The DOS for a-Si is similar to the 
DOS of crystalline silicon,
\cite{williams_numerical_1985,donadio_atomistic_2009} with 
pronounced features at mid-range and high 
frequencies. The DOS for 
a-SiO$_2$ is essentially constant over most of the frequency-range, 
with a gap at the higher frequencies due to the presence of 
the oxygen atoms.(cite)   
There is a clear scaling of $DOS \propto \omega^{-2}$ for both 
a-Si and a-SiO$_2$ at the lowest frequencies. 
The onset of this scaling occurs at a higher frequency 
for a-Si than a-SiO$_2$. This scaling of the DOS 
at low frequencies is predicted by the Debye model 
(Eq. \eqref{EQ:DOS_debye}) 
which is based on a linear, isotropic crystal.(cite) 
The DOS scaling at the lowest 
frequencies for a-SiO2 and a-Si suggest that the modes may be 
propagating (phonon-like),  
which is investigated in the following sections. 

% The observation that the acoustic modes are located on
% top of a flat background for intermediate values of q has re-
% cently been found by G ̈
% otze and Mayr as an essential
% result in their analytic calculation of the spectra within
% mode-coupling theory.
% \cite{gotze_evolution_2000}
% 
% The DOS predicted for a-SiO2 is similar to previous 
% models\cite{taraskin_phonons_1997} as well as 
% experimentally measured DOS.(cite)
% 
% The DOS predicted for jammed systems are similarly dominated by 
% the transverse sound speed,\cite{vitelli_heat_2010} 
% while results for disordered lattices demonstrate 
% \cite{beltukov_ioffe-regel_2013,larkin_predicting_2013}

\caption{\label{FIG:DOS} Vibrational DOS predicted for our 
models of a-SiO2 and a-Si using Eq. \eqref{EQ:DOS}. Both models 
show a scaling at low frequency $DOS(\omega)\propto\omega^{-2}$,

(Eq. \eqref{EQ:DOS_debye}) using the transverse sound speeds 
predicted using various methods (Table \ref{T:vs}). At high frequency, 
the DOS of a-SiO2 shows a plateau and then a sharp feature corresponding 
to a gap in the vibrational spectrum due to the Si and O bonds.(cite) 
For a-Si, there are two sharp peaks, which show as small peaks in the 
predictions of the vibrational mode lifetimes (Fig. \ref{FIG:Lifetimes}) 
and mode diffusivities (Fig. \ref{FIG:diffusivities}).}

\subsection{\label{S:Structure}Structure Factor}
%--------------------------------------------------------------------------

Calculating the structure factors of the supercell Gamma   
modes is a method to test for their propagating (plane-wave)  
character at a particular wave vector and 
polarization. 
\cite{allen_diffusons_1999,feldman_numerical_1999} 
The structure factor has been used to predict effective 
dispersion of amorphous materials 
experimentally(cite more)\cite{green_density_2011} 
and 
numerically (cite more).
\cite{feldman_numerical_1999,volz_molecular-dynamics_2000} 
The structure factor at a wave vector 
$\pmb{\kappa}$ is defined as\cite{allen_diffusons_1999} 
\begin{equation}\label{EQ:SLT}
S^{L,T}\kw = 
\sum_{\nu} E^{L,T}\kv
\delta (\omega-\omega\kgv),
\end{equation}
where the summation is over the Gamma modes, $E^{T}$ refers 
to the transverse polarization and is defined as
\begin{equation}\label{EQ:EL}
E^L\kv = 
\left|
\sum_{b} 
\hat{\pmb{\kappa}} \cdot e\kgvba 
\EXP{i\pmb{\kappa}\cdot\pmb{r}_0\ab{l=0}{b}} 
\right|^2
\end{equation}
and $E^{L}$ refers to the longitudinal polarization and is defined as
\begin{equation}\label{EQ:ET}
E^T\kv = 
\left|
\sum_{b} 
\hat{\pmb{\kappa}} \times e\kgvba 
\EXP{i\pmb{\kappa}\cdot\pmb{r}_0\ab{l=0}{b}} 
\right|^2.
\end{equation}
In Eqs. \eqref{EQ:EL} and \eqref{EQ:ET}, the $b$ summations are 
over the atoms in the disordered supercell, 
$\pmb{r}_0\ab{l=0}{b}$ refers to the equilibrium atomic position of 
atom $b$, $l$ labels the unit cells 
($l=0$ for the supercell), 
$\alpha$ labels the Cartesian coordinates, and 
$\hat{\pmb{\kappa}}$ is a unit vector.  
The vibrational ``mode shape'' is contained in the 
$3N_a$ components of its eigenvector, $e\kgvba$.(cite)

The structure factors $S^{L,T}\knw$ are plotted in Fig. 
\ref{FIG:disp} for 
a-SiO$_2$ and a-Si (left and right panels) for wavevectors along the 
[100] direction of the 
supercells. Because of isotropy, the direction is not important 
and the wavenumber can be considered instead of wavevector. 
The wavenumbers are normalized by a maximum wavenumber 
$\kappa_{max}$ which corresponds to $2\pi/a$. The length scale 
$a$ is $a = $ 4.8(5.43) $\AA$ for a-SiO$_2$(a-Si), which is based 
on the lattice constants of c-SiO2(c-Si).(cite)

Frequencies ($\omega_0(\kappa)$) and linewidths ($\Gamma(\kappa)$) are 
predicted by fitting each structure 
factor peak $S^{L,T}\knw$ to a Lorentzian function
\begin{equation}\label{EQ:Lorentzian_SLT}
\begin{split}
S^{L,T}\knw = 
\frac{C_0(\pmb{\kappa})}{[\omega_0(\pmb{\kappa})-\omega]^2+\Gamma^2(\pmb{\kappa})},
\end{split}
\end{equation}
where $C_0(\nu)$ is a constant related to the DOS.
\cite{beltukov_ioffe-regel_2013} A dispersion relation is identified by 
plotting $\omega_0(\kappa)$ in the middle panel of Fig.\ref{FIG:disp}, 
where the error bars 
indicate the linewidths $\Gamma(\kappa)$. 

For a-Si, the peaks are reasonably Lorentzian for all wavenumbers considered.
\cite{feldman_calculations_2002} 
For a-SiO2, the peaks are well-approximated as Lorentzian only at the 
smallest wavenumbers. For 
large wavenumber, the structure factors peaks are much less than an order 
of magnitude larger than the background, and the widths are on the order 
of the frequency range considered in Fig. \ref{FIG:disp}.(cite) For 
large wavenumber the structure factor takes on the form of the vibrational 
DOS. 

Fig. ref shows the dispersion extracted by locating the peaks in 
the structure factor for a-SiO2 and a-Si. For a-Si, the dispersion is 
nearly linear at small $\kappa$ with slight concave-down dispersion at 
high $\kappa$.(cite) For a-SiO2, the dispersion is concave-down for 
the smallest wavenumbers considered, transitioning to a strong 
concave-up dispersion at intermediate wavenumber. 
For intermediate $\kappa$, the longitudinal dispersion for a-SiO$_2$ 
is better-described by the so-called 
''dispersion law for diffusons``, where $\omega \propto \kappa^2$.
\cite{beltukov_ioffe-regel_2013} This large concave-up dispersion has been 
observed in various amorphous models\cite{feldman_calculations_2002} 
including of a-SiO2.\cite{ruzicka_evidence_2004} 
The dispersion predicted by the structure factors show that a-Si 
has a near-linear, crystal-like dispersion while the dispersion 
for a-SiO2 is more diffuson-like,(cite) at least over the range of 
wavenumber and frequencies considered here.  At lower frequencies 
($< 100$ GHz)(cite), experimental measurements of a-SiO2 show a 
linear dispersion. 

%--------------------------------------------------------------------------
\subsection{\label{S:Vg}Group Velocity}
%--------------------------------------------------------------------------

The DOS and structure factors predicted in Sections \ref{S:DOS} and 
\ref{S:Structure} are now used to 
predict the group velocity of modes at the lowest-frequencies for 
a-SiO2 and a-Si. In the low-frequency, long-wavelength limit the 
mode group velocities are the sound speed.(cite) 
By fitting the DOS 
from Fig. \ref{FIG:DOS} to Eq. \eqref{EQ:DOS_debye}, 
a sound speed is predicted $v_{s,DOS}$ and 
reported in Table \ref{T:vs}. Because the DOS is a mixture of 
transverse and longitudinal modes only a single sound speed is predicted. 
Both longitudinal and transverse sound speeds can be predicted from 
the structure factor.(cite) 
Sound speeds are estimated from the structure factor peaks by finite 
differencing,\begin{equation}\label{EQ:vs_dwdk}
v_{s} = \frac{ \delta \omega_0(\kappa)}{\delta \kappa},
\end{equation}
and are shown in Table using the lowest frequency peaks 
from Fig. \ref{FIG:disp}. 
The transverse and longitudinal sound speeds of a material can 
also be predicted from the material's bulk ($G$) and 
shear ($K$) moduli.(cite) The transverse sound speed is given by(cite)  
\begin{equation}\label{EQ:vs_T_elas}
v_{s,T} = \frac{G}{\rho}^{1/2},
\end{equation}
and the longitudinal by
\begin{equation}\label{EQ:vs_L_elas}
v_{s,L} = \frac{4G + 3K}{3\rho}^{1/2}.
\end{equation}
We use the bulk and shear moduli defined in terms of the elastic 
constants according to the Voight convention.(cite) 
The sound speeds calculated from the 
elastic constants are reported in Table . 
The sound speeds predicted for a-Si in Table are in good agreement 
with those found in a previous study using a similar 
model.\cite{feldman_thermal_1993,feldman_numerical_1999} 
Comment about a-SiO2 sound speeds with expt and modeling.(cite)

It is clear that the DOS of 
our models for a-Si and a-SiO$_2$ are characterized by using the 
transverse sound speeds, rather than an averaging of the transverse 
and longitudinal which is commonly used,(cite)  
\begin{equation}\label{EQ:vs_avg}
v_{s} = \frac{2}{3}v_{s,L} + \frac{1}{3}v_{s,T}. 
\end{equation} 
The values of the transverse sound speeds obtained from the 
elastic moduli are somewhat larger than the structure factors, 
an indication of the concave-down dispersion seen at low 
$\kappa$, particularly for a-SiO2 (Fig. ).
(cite) For a-SiO2, the concave-down dispersion
also affects the low-frequency DOS, where the predicted sound speed 
$v_{s,DOS}$ is less than that predicted from the structure factor 
and the elastic constants (Table ). The concave-down dispersion 
is less pronounced for a-Si, where the sound speeds predicted 
by all three methods are within five percent of each other. 

Under the Debye model (Eq. \eqref{EQ:DOS_debye}), 
the $\emph{smaller}$ transverse sound speed 
makes the $\emph{larger}$ contribution to the DOS which scales 
as the sound speed cubed. For a-Si, 
the contribution from longitudinal modes to the Debye DOS is nearly 
an order of magnitude less than the transverse modes for a given 
frequency interval (Table ). For a-SiO$_2$, the longitudinal and 
transverse sound speeds are closer, but the concave-down dispersion 
is stronger than a-Si (Fig. ).(cite experimental DOS) 
The intensity of the structure factors  
are directly proportional to the DOS.(cite)
The intensity for the dynamic structure factor of transverse 
polarizations has been found to be four to five\cite{taraskin_phonons_1997} 
and six to eight\cite{horbach_high_2001} times larger than longitudinal 
polarizations for models 
of a-SiO2, which supports our finding that the DOS is dominated 
by transverse modes. 
The transverse sound speed predicted by the DOS $v_{s,DOS}$ is used for both 
a-SiO$_2$ and a-Si throughout the rest of this work and is discussed 
in Section \ref{S:Discussion}.

For a disordered solid, 
except for the transverse and longitudinal sound speeds, there is not an 
accepted method to predict the group velocity of each  
vibrational mode. 
While the structure factor gives the frequency spectrum needed to 
construct a propagating state with pure wavevector $\pmb{\kappa}$, 
the mode spectrum $E^{T,L}\kv$ (Eqs. and ) predicts the plane-wave 
character of each mode. As shown previously, it is not possible 
in general 
to assign a unique wavevector to individual modes, even at low frequency,
\cite{biswas_vibrational_1988,feldman_thermal_1993,silbert_normal_2009} 
which makes predicting individual mode group velocities challenging. 
Attempts have been made to predict individual mode group velocities,
\cite{cahill_lattice_1988,duda_reducing_2011,donadio_atomistic_2009,
he_heat_2011,he_thermal_2011,hori_phonon_2013} 
but 
it is not clear that these methods are consistent with the predictions 
made by the structure factor.(cite) 
In the Cahill-Pohl (CP) model, for example, the group velocity of 
all disordered modes is the sound speed, $v_s$, which is also assumed  
for the HS model Eq. \eqref{EQ:M:k_AF,HS}.
\cite{cahill_lattice_1988} This assumption is not generally valid  
for any material.\cite{feldman_numerical_1999,duda_reducing_2011,
donadio_atomistic_2009,he_heat_2011,he_thermal_2011,larkin_predicting_2013}
To treat this problem, we focus on the mode thermal diffusivities 
and compare predictions from the 
NMD method (Section \ref{S:Life}) and AF theory in 
Section \ref{S:Diffusivities}.

\subsection{\label{S:Life}Mode Lifetimes}
%--------------------------------------------------------------------------

We now predict the lifetimes of all vibrational modes in our 
models of a-SiO2 and a-Si using the MD simulation-based normal mode 
decomposition (NMD) method.
\cite{ladd_lattice_1986,mcgaughey_quantitative_2004,
turney_predicting_2009-1,larkin_comparison_2012} 
The NMD-predicted lifetimes will be 
compared with the timescales extracted from the structure 
factor linewidths, $\tau_{SF} = 1/2\Gamma(\kappa)$ 
(Section \ref{S:Structure}, (Eq. \eqref{EQ:Lorentzian_SLT})). 
The NMD method can predict vibrational lifetimes which are affected by 
the disorder in the supercell.
\cite{he_heat_2011,he_thermal_2011,he_morphology_2011,he_lattice_2013,
larkin_predicting_2013}

In NMD, the 
atomic trajectories from MD simulations are first mapped onto the vibrational 
mode coordinate time derivative,
\cite{dove_introduction_1993}
\begin{equation}\label{EQ:qdot}
\begin{split}
\dot{q}\kgvt{}{}{}=&\SUM{0}{}\sqrt{\frac{m_b}{N}}\dot{u}_{\alpha}
\lbt e^*\kgvba\EXP{i(\pmb{0}\cdot\mathbf{r}_0\ab{l}{0}}.
\end{split}
\end{equation}
Here, $m_b$ is the mass of the $b_{th}$ atom in the supercell, 
$u_{\alpha}$ is the $\alpha$-component of the atomic displacement 
from equilibrium, $\dot{u}_{\alpha}$ is the $\alpha$-component 
of the atomic velocity, and $t$ is time. Because the supercells 
of a-SiO2 and a-Si are disordered, the NMD method is performed at 
the wavevector $\pmb{\kappa} = \pmb{0}$. 
The spectral energy of each vibrational mode, $\Phi\kvt$, is calculated 
from 
\begin{equation}\label{A:E:Phi_NMD}
\begin{split}
\Phi(\nu,\omega) = 
\lim_{\tau_0\rightarrow\infty}\frac{1}{2\tau_0}
\left|\frac{1}{\sqrt{2\pi}}\int_{0}^{\tau_0}\dot{q}\kgvt
\exp(-i\omega t)dt\right|^2.
\end{split}
\end{equation}
We choose the frequency domain representation of the normal mode 
energy because it is less sensitive to any meta-stability 
of the amorphous structure.(footnote) 
(footnote)In an amorphous material, there are many potential energy 
configurations 
(atomic positions) which are nearly equivalent in energy.  At a sufficient 
temperature, the meta-stable configurations cause the equilibrium 
atomic positions to vary in time.  This can effect on the prediction of 
the vibrational mode 
lifetimes when using the normal 
mode decomposition method. In the time domain, the average normal 
mode potential and kinetic energy must be calculated and subtracted 
from the normal mode energy autocorrelation function.(cite) 
If the average 
energy is not specified correctly, unphysically large or small mode 
lifetimes can be predicted.(cite)
(footnote) 
The vibrational mode frequency and lifetime is predicted by fitting each mode's 
spectral energy $\Phi(\nu,\omega)$ to a Lorentzian function
\begin{equation}\label{EQ:Lorentzian_NMD}
\begin{split}
\Phi(\nu,\omega) = 
\frac{C_0(\nu)}{[\omega_0(\nu)-\omega]^2+\Gamma^2(\nu)},
\end{split}
\end{equation}
where the constant $C_0(\nu)$ is related to the average energy of 
each mode and the linewidth $\Gamma(\nu)$ and is valid when 
$\Gamma(\nu) < \omega_0(\nu)$.\cite{larkin_comparison_2012} 
The mode lifetime is given by(cite) 
\begin{equation}\label{EQ:NMD_life}
\begin{split}
\tau(\nu) = \frac{1}{2\Gamma(\nu)}
\end{split}
\end{equation}

The NMD-predicted lifetimes are plotted in Fig. \ref{FIG:Lifetimes} 
for a-SiO2 and a-Si. 
For a-SiO2, the mode lifetimes are generally larger than 
the Ioffe-Regel limit $\tau = 2\pi/\omega$,(cite) and follow 
this limit at low frequency. There is no clear evidence for a
scaling $\tau\propto\omega^{-2}$, which 
corresponds to a scaling of the diffusivity at low 
frequency Eq. \eqref{EQ:Dw2} with $n=2$.  
At high frequency the mode lifetimes are roughly constant 
without definite scaling. There is a peak near 
2 $10^{14}$ rads$/$s which corresponds to a peak in the DOS 
(see Fig. \ref{FIG:DOS}).  The lifetimes predicted from the 
structure factor fall below the NMD-predicted lifetimes 
and the IR limit. This is because the structure factor for 
a-SiO2 is evaluated for large enough wavenumber that the 
peaks are not well-approximated as Lorentzian.(cite) Fitting 
the peaks we find the linewidth (inverse lifetime) 
to be on the order of the frequency range considered in 
Fig. \ref{FIG:disp}. 
Models(cite) and theoretical(cite) predictions show that the 
structure factor begins to take on the form of the DOS 
for large enough wavenumber,
\cite{martin-mayor_dynamical_2001,baldi_thermal_2008} and the 
linewidths (timescales) are not meaningful. For a-SiO2 the NMD and 
structure factor-predicted lifetimes indicate that the 
low-frequency modes 
in our model are not well-characterized as propagating.(cite)  

For a-Si, 
The mode lifetimes show a clear scaling at low frequency 
$\tau\propto\omega^{-2}$. The lifetimes plateau at higher frequencies,
over a wider range of frequencies than a-SiO2, with two peaks 
corresponding to peaks in the DOS (Fig. \ref{FIG:DOS}). The plateau of 
lifetimes at high frequencies has been 
reported for disordered lattices
\cite{sheng_heat_1991,larkin_predicting_2013} and 
other models of a-Si.\cite{he_heat_2011} 
The transition from the low-frequency scaling to 
the plateau region occurs near 
$10^{14}$ rads$/$s, which corresponds to where the DOS peaks in Fig. 
\ref{FIG:DOS}. 
Similar behavior has been observed for models of disordered lattices.
\cite{larkin_predicting_2013} The lifetimes predicted by the 
structure factor are in good agreement with those predicted by NMD 
at low frequencies. Similar agreement has been reported in other 
models of topologically disordered materials.
\cite{mazzacurati_low-frequency_1996} 
The longitudinal and transverse polarizations 
outline the scatter in the NMD-predicted lifetimes. While the DOS 
at low frequency is 
dominated by transverse modes, the NMD and 
structure factor-predicted lifetimes indicate there 
is some mixture of longitudinal and transverse-like modes.(cite) 

The NMD-predicted lifetimes in this work are similar in magnitude to 
those predicted for previous models of a-Si.
\cite{bickham_calculation_1998,bickham_numerical_1999} 
Fabian and Allen find lifetimes on the order of picoseconds for a-Si
\cite{fabian_anharmonic_1996} and para-crystalline silicon.
\cite{fabian_numerical_2003} 
A previous study of Tersoff a-Si predicted vibrational lifetimes on 
the order of 100 ps, about ten times the values reported here and in 
other studies.(cite) It is unclear what the source of this 
discrepancy is, although the analysis in Ref \citenum{he_thermal_2011} 
the NMD method in the time domain. Using the Tersoff potential on the 
WWW a-Si models in this work we find...
Predicted lifetimes are also similar for 
samples created using a melt-quench technique 
(see Section \ref{S:Sample:Si}).

\subsection{\label{S:Diffusivities}Diffusivities}
%--------------------------------------------------------------------------

Using the sound speeds predicted 
from the DOS $v_{s,DOS}$ (Table \ref{T:vs}), the NMD-predicted lifetimes 
are used to predict the mode diffusivities with Eq. \eqref{EQ:Dtau} 
and are shown in Fig. for a-SiO2 and a-Si. 
The sound speed is most appropriate  
for the lowest-frequency modes (see Section \ref{S:Vg}). To compare with 
the NMD predictions, the AF theory is also used to predict the mode 
diffusivities (see Section \ref{S:Diffusivities}) which are shown 
in Fig. . 

For a-SiO2 at the lowest frequencies, the 
diffusivities scale roughly as Eq. \eqref{EQ:Dw2} with $n=2$.  
However this 
scaling is not definitive for the diffusivities predicted by either 
method, particularly for the NMD predictions, which 
is apparent from the scaling of the NMD-predicted lifetimes 
in Fig. . To identify the transition from propagating 
to non-propagating modes, we use $\omega_{cut} = 4.55 10^{12}$ rad$/$s 
for Eq. \eqref{EQ:kvib}, 
the same as that used in Ref \citenum{baldi_thermal_2008} since 
there is no clear indication of this transition from Fig. . 
This choice is discussed in Section \ref{S:Bulk}. The constant 
$B=$ in Eq. \eqref{EQ:Dw2} 
is fit to the AF-predicted diffusivities for 
$\omega \le \omega_{cut}$.

For a-Si at low frequencies there is a clear scaling of the 
diffusivities Eq. \eqref{EQ:Dw2} with $n=2$.  
The NMD-predicted diffusivities show much less 
scatter than those predicted by the AF theory, which is due to 
the finite-size system and the broadening which is required to evaluate 
Eq. \eqref{EQ:DAF}.\cite{feldman_thermal_1993} By using a much larger 
broadening ($~100\delta\omega_{avg}$) the scatter in the AF-predicted 
diffusivities at low frequency can be smoothed, but at the cost of 
decreasing the diffusivities at intermediate and high frequencies. 
It is possible that a frequency-dependent broadening may be necessary 
for a-Si and the AF theory,(cite)  
but determining this dependence is not clear nor necessary for 
interpreting the results in this work.  

For a-Si, we choose $\omega_{cut}=1.16 10^13$ rads$/$s 
and $B$ so that Eq. \eqref{EQ:Dw2} is equal 
to the AF-predicted diffusivity at $\omega=\omega_{cut}$. This choice 
allows Eq. \eqref{EQ:Dw2} to pass reasonably well through both the AF and NMD-predicted 
diffusivities.  The value of $\omega_{cut}$ and $B$ are comparable to 
those used in Ref. .  For a-Si we also consider a separate scaling 
for Eq. \eqref{EQ:Dw2} with $n=4$ which is discussed in Section \ref{S:Discussion}. 
Because this scaling is not clear from the data in Fig. we use 
$\omega_{cut} = $ 1.52 $10^13$ rads$/$s  
from Refs. \ref{feldman_numerical_1999} and \ref{cahill_lower_1994} 
and choose $B$ so that Eq. \eqref{EQ:Dw2} is equal to the AF-predicted 
diffusivity at $\omega_{cut}$. We discuss these choices in 
Section \ref{S:Discussion}. 

For a-SiO2, the mode diffusivities predicted by NMD and AF agree 
well over the entire frequency range. At high frequencies the 
diffusivities do not vary much, except for a 
peak for the NMD predictions near 2 $10^{14}$ rads/s which 
corresponds to the same peak in lifetimes (Fig. ). For 
the AF predictions, the mode diffusivities near 
2 $10^{14}$ rads/s and at the highest frequencies 
show a sharp decrease, which is an indication 
that these modes are localized.(cite) 

Both a-SiO$_2$ and a-Si have a region at higher frequencies where the 
AF-predicted mode diffusivities are relatively constant. This behavior 
has been reported for a number of model disordered systems such as 
disordered lattices
\cite{sheng_heat_1991,beltukov_ioffe-regel_2013,larkin_predicting_2013}, 
amorphous solids,\cite{he_thermal_2011} 
and jammed systems.\cite{xu_energy_2009,vitelli_heat_2010}  
For a-Si the NMD- and AF-predicted diffusivities diverge 
near 1 $10^{13}$ rads$/$s, while the NMD-predicted lifetimes 
are relatively constant above this frequency.  

While diffusons are non-propagating modes whose MFPs are not 
well-defined, a diffuson MFP can be defined as
\begin{equation}\label{EQ:LambdaAF}
\begin{split}
\Lambda_{AF}(\omega) = (3D_{AF,i}(\omega)\tau(\omega))^{1/2},
\end{split}
\end{equation}
where $\tau(\omega)$ are the NMD-predicted lifetimes. Using this 
definition, $\Lambda_{AF}(\omega)$ is found to vary 
for a-SiO2 and a-Si between 
the supercell size $L$ and the lattice constant $a$ 
(see Section \ref{S:Sample}) for modes with $\omega > \omega_{cut}$. 
Similar MFPs have been estimated for a-Si in 
previous studies.\cite{feldman_thermal_1993,feldman_numerical_1999} 
This is in contrast to the MFPs estimated in Ref \citenum{he_heat_2011}
which were found to be up to approximately $70 L$. The reason 
for this discrepancy is some combination of the predicted lifetimes 
and the method with which the mode group velocities were estimated.
\cite{he_heat_2011}

% This implies 
% that the velocity scale for diffusons,
% \begin{equation}\label{EQ:vAF}
% \begin{split}
% v_{AF}(\omega) = \left(3\frac{D_{AF,i}(\omega)}{\tau(\omega)}\right)^{1/2},
% \end{split}
% \end{equation}
% is a function of frequency. At low frequencies, $v_{AF}$ 
% reaches as high as $v_{s,DOS}$ and decreases to about $(1/3) v_{s,DOS}$ 
% at higher frequencies. This variation of $v_{AF}(\omega)$ is similar 
% to the variation of the group velocity which can be estimated from 
% the dispersion relation found in Fig. . For a-SiO2, $v_{AF}$ is near 
% $v_{s,DOS}$ over the whole frequency range, which is the assumption 
% made for the high-scatter limit Eq. .
% 
% (WORK)
% 
% The dependence of $v_{AF}$ with frequency for a-Si is similar to 
% that found for 
% simple crystalline systems, where negative dispersion typically 
% causes a decrease of group velocity with increasing frequency (or 
% wavevector).(cite) Negative dispersion has been predicted by many 
% models of both a-SiO2 and a-Si,\cite{ruocco_relaxation_2000} 
% as have experimental measurement of 
% dispersion relations.(cite) The effective group velocities 
% which have been predicted using dispersion relations near zero 
% wavevector for large supercells of amorphous\cite{he_thermal_2011,he_heat_2011} 
% and disordered lattices\cite{hori_phonon_2013} would appear to 
% be underestimates 
% compared with the effective velocities $v_{AF}$ predicted in this work, 
% where $v_{AF}$ is within a factor of three of $v_s$ for all but the 
% highest frequency, localized modes.(cite) Our predictions for 
% $v_{AF}$ also support the notion of a minimum thermal diffusivity 
% on the order of $D_{HS}$ for all vibrational modes except   
% those which are localized (the so-called ''locons'').(cite) 

% To predict $k_{vib}$ we choose $\omega_{cut}$, 
% the constant $B$ for the diffusivity scaling, and the sound speed 
% $v_{s}$. For both a-SiO2 and a-Si, we use the sound speeds predicted 
% by a fit to the low-frequency DOS (Fig. \ref{FIG:DOS}). 
% For a-Si, the constant $B$ for the quadratic scaling is chosen such 
% that $D(\omega) = D_{AF,i}$ for $\omega_i=1.16$ rad$/$s. This value 
% of $\omega_{cut}$ is somewhat smaller than that used in Ref and . 
% The constant $B$ we find is somewhat larger than that found in 
% Ref. and . We choose this $\omega$ because of the reasonable agreement 
% between the AF-predicted $D_{AF}$ and NMD-predicted $D_{NMD}$ in this 
% frequency region, shown in Fig. \ref{FIG:diffusivities}. 
% 
% For a-Si a quadratic scaling is also 
% considered using $\omega_{cut}$ from the study by . As there is no clear 
% evidence of a quartic scaling of diffusivity, we choose the constant 
% $B$ to pass visibly through both $D_{AF}$ and $D_{NMD}$ in 
% Fig. \ref{FIG:diffusivities} because there is no clear procedure 
% to perform a fit. Our choice of $B=9.0 10^{46}$ m$^@$/s (rads$/$s)^4 
% for the quartic scaling is nearly the same as a fit\cite{cahill_lower_1994} 
% to the diffusivities in Ref \citenum{feldman_thermal_1993}, 
% $B=1.23 10^{47}$ m$^@$/s (rads$/$s)^4. 
% When using the quartic diffusivity scaling $D(\omega)\propto\omega^{-4}$, 
% the thermal conductivity is divergent as the frequency goes to zero.
% (cite) The thermal conductivity can be made finite using a boundary 
% scattering models,(cite) such as the simple one considered in 
% Section \ref{S:Bulk}. 
% While a fit to our model is not possible for the quartic scaling, 
% it has been used to explain previous experimental measurements of 
% a-Si thin films.(cite)
% 
% Baldi et al used a $\omega_{cut}=$ $4.55$ rads$/$s, which is a 
% reasonable 
% cut-off for our model of a-Si.\cite{baldi_thermal_2008} 
% Baldi et al find that the contribution $k_{ph}~0.1$ W/m-K, which is 
% the same as the contribution $k_{ph}$ predicted in this work for 
% a-SiO2. This contribution 
% $k_{ph}$ is smaller than the error bars in the predictions of $k_{vib}$ 
% and $k_{GK}$ shown in Figs. and .  
% 
% The quadratic scaling of mode diffusivities at low frequencies 
% for a-Si 
% is responsible for the system size dependent thermal conductivity 
% predicted by the GK method $k_{GK}$. 
% While our model is best described by 
% quadratic scaling, we are modeling bulk a-Si. 

% Based on the NMD-predicted diffusivities, the modes at low frequency are 
% dominated by transverse modes. However, given the scatter in the 
% NMD-predicted lifetimes, there is some mixture of 
% transverse and longitudinal 
% modes at low frequency.  Treating these two branches separately 
% is not necessary since similar results are obtained by assuming a single 
% branch scaling $D(\omega)=B\omega^{-2}$ which is fit to coincide with the 
% peak in diffusivity $D_{AF}$ at $\omega_{cut} = $ 11.6 E 12 rads/s. This 
% choice of $\omega_{cut}$ is close to that used by 
% FAB ($\omega_{cut}$ = 9.65 E 12 rads/s),\cite{feldman_thermal_1993} 
% and is somewhat smaller than 
% that used by FKAW\cite{feldman_numerical_1999} 
% and Cahill et al.\cite{cahill_thermal_1994} 
% ($\omega_{cut}$ = 15.2 E 12 rads/s). 


% It was shown that the diffusivity $D_{AF}(\omega) \propto DOS(\omega)$ 
% at low frequency when the modes are spatially uncorrelated and the 
% overlap between them is small and independent of the frequency.
% \cite{vitelli_heat_2010,xu_energy_2009} This result helps to explain 
% the plateau of diffusivity for both a-SiO2 and a-Si at higher 
% frequencies. The features in $D_{AF,i}$ for both a-SiO2 and a-Si can 
% be explained by peaks in the DOS at these frequencies.

\section{\label{S:Conductivity}Thermal Conductivity}
%--------------------------------------------------------------------------

%--------------------------------------------------------------------------
\subsection{\label{S:Bulk}Bulk}
%--------------------------------------------------------------------------

To predict the bulk thermal conductivity for our models of a-SiO2 and 
a-Si, we use Eq. \eqref{EQ:kvib} 
and the GK method.(cite) The GK method for predicting 
thermal conductivity
is relatively inexpensive compared to the NMD and AF methods so  
large system sizes can be studied (see Section \ref{S:Sample:Si}).  
Similarly-large 
models of a-Si were studied in Ref. \citenum{he_heat_2011} using the 
MD-based direct method to predict thermal conductivity. The 
details of the GK method are discussed in Section \ref{S:Simulation}. 

The GK-predicted thermal conductivities $k_{GK}$ for a-SiO2 and a-Si 
are plotted in Fig. \ref{FIG:cond} for 
varying system sizes $L$. For a-SiO2, there is no apparent dependence 
of $k_{GK}$ on $L$, and a bulk thermal conductivity is estimated 
to be $k_{bulk}=2.10 \pm 0.20$ W/m-K. 
For a-Si, there is a clear dependence of $k_{GK}$ on 
$L$. Assuming the DOS has the form of Eq. \eqref{EQ:DOS_debye} 
and the diffusivity scaling 
is Eq. \eqref{EQ:Dw2} with $n=2$ 
for the low-frequency modes, 
the thermal conductivity as a function of the system size 
takes the form
\begin{equation}\label{EQ:k0}
\frac{k_{GK}(L)}{k_{bulk}} = 1 - \frac{c_0}{L},
\end{equation}
where $k_{bulk}$ is the extrapolated bulk thermal conductivity and $c_0$ 
is a constant.\cite{shiomi_thermal_2011,esfarjani_heat_2011,
larkin_comparison_2012} 
The extrapolation is performed using the three largest 
system sizes studied, including the tiled 800,000 atom sample (see 
Section \ref{S:Sample:Si}). 
We do not observe that tiling an a-Si model increases 
the thermal 
conductivity of a given system size above that predicted by 
Eq. \eqref{EQ:k0}, as 
was found in Ref \citenum{he_thermal_2011} using the MD-based 
direct method. This is likely due to the 
small ($N_a = $ 512) model used to perform the tiling in that study, 
while we use a large ($N_a = 100,000$) model. 
The success of 
Eq. \eqref{EQ:k0} for describing $k_{GK}(L)$ for our model of a-Si 
is in agreement with the scaling Eq. \eqref{EQ:Dw2} with $n=2$ 
(Fig. \ref{FIG:diffusivities} 
and the Debye-scaling of the DOS (Fig. \ref{FIG:DOS}). 
For a-Si, the extrapolated $k_{bulk} = 1.97 \pm 0.15$ W/m-K

To predict $k_{vib}$ (Eq. \eqref{EQ:kvib}) we use the input parameters 
($B$ and $\omega_{cut}$) and the AF-predicted diffusivities 
$D_{AF}(\omega)$ obtained in Section \ref{S:Diffusivities}. 
For a-SiO2 using Eq. \eqref{EQ:Dw2} with $n=2$ $k_{AF} = 1.92$, 
$k_{pr} = 0.09$ W/m-K, and 
$k_{vib} = 2.01$ W/m-K, which is equal to $k_{bulk}$ within 
the errors.  
Baldi et al. estimated a similar value $k_{pr}\approx0.1$ W/m-K 
for a-SiO2.\cite{baldi_thermal_2008} 
We consider the contribution 
$k_{pr}$ predicted in this work to be an upper-bound considering 
the lack of definitive scaling of Eq. with $n=2$ (see Fig. ). 
Within the errors of the predictions, $k_{pr}$ is not a significant 
fraction of $k_{vib}$ for a-SiO2. 

For a-Si with Eq. \eqref{EQ:Dw2} and $n=2$, 
$k_{AF} = 1.16$ and $k_{pr} = 0.63$ W/m-K. For Eq. \eqref{EQ:Dw2} 
and $n=4$, the 
diverging conductivity at low frequency is fixed by the 
use of a simple boundary scattering model based on the Matthiessen 
rule and the thin-film thickness $t_f$,\cite{sellan_cross-plane_2010} 
\begin{equation}\label{EQ:LambdaMatth}
\begin{split}
\frac{1}{\Lambda_{eff}} = \frac{1}{\Lambda_{bulk}} + 
\frac{2}{t_f}.
\end{split}
\end{equation}
Using the largest $t_f = 80$ $\mu$m from the literature
(cite) gives $k_{pr} = 2.98$ W/m-K. 
Using the $n=2$ scaling and $t_f = 80,000$ nm does not change 
$k_{pr}$ within the precision reported. For $t_f = 50$ nm, 
$k_{pr} = 0.22$ W/m-K for $n=4$ 
and $k_{pr} = 0.34$ W/m-K for $n=2$. For $n=4$, using the 
same 
The same $\omega_{cut}$ was used by Cahill et al. 
together with a Rayleigh scaling and a boundary scattering model to 
find $k_{ph} = 0.31$ W/m-K.\cite{cahill_thermal_1994} 

In Section \ref{S:Theory:Thermal} we approximated the specific heat 
of the propagating 
and non-propagating (diffusons) modes by the classical-limit 
value $C(\omega) = k_{B}$.    
The full quantum expression for the specific heat is
\begin{equation}\label{EQ:Cquantum}
\begin{split}
C(\omega) = k_{B}\frac{\hbar\omega/2k_{B}T}{sinh(\hbar\omega/2k_{B}T)}^2,
\end{split}
\end{equation}
where $T$ is the temperature and $C(\omega/T)\approxk_{B}$ as $\omega/T$ 
goes to zero (classical limit).(cite) 
For a temperature $T=300$ K, $C(\omega/T) = 0.98 k_{B}$ 
for $\omega = \omega_{cut} = 1.52 10^{13}$ rads$/$s, the largest 
$\omega_{cut}$ used for a-SiO2 or a-Si in this work. Using the 
classical limit for specific heat is a good approximation for the 
modes considered in $k_{pr}$, while it is an approximation for the 
high-frequency modes in our models. For a-SiO2(a-Si), the maximum 
frequency in the model is 
$\omega_{max} = 2.48 (1.22) 10^{14}$ rads$/$s and 
$C(\omega/T) = 0.073 (0.47) k_{B}$. Thus the quantum effect on 
$C(\omega/T)$ affects the 
contribution $k_{AF}$ only, which we can consider to be an 
adjustable constant in $k_{vib}$. Using Eq. \eqref{EQ:Cquantum} gives 
$k_{AF} = 1.22 (0.96) $ W/m-K   
for a-SiO2(a-Si). This correction brings 
the overestimate of $k_{vib}$ for a-SiO2 into better 
agreement with experimental measurements by Regner et al. (see Fig.). 
For a-Si the modified $k_{AF}$ is closer to the classical-limit value, 
which does not significantly change the predicted $k_{vib}$ in Fig. . 
Because the change in $k_{AF}$ due to quantum effects are reasonably 
small, particularly for a-Si, 
we keep the classical-limit value to compare with the MD-based 
GK predictions in Fig. .  In particular, this allows us to verify that 
the scaling Eq. \eqref{EQ:Dw2} with $n=2$ describes the low-frequency 
contribution $k_{pr}$ for our model of bulk a-Si. 

The relative contributions of $k_{pr}$ and $k_{AF}$ to $k_{vib}$ have 
been estimated from experiments and modeling for 
a-Si and a-SiO2. At 300 K for a-Si modeled by the Tersoff potential,   
$k_{ph} \approx k_{AF}$.\cite{he_heat_2011} Earlier studies using 
similar models of a-Si to those used in this work find 
that $k_{pr}$ is less than half of 
$k_{vib}$.\cite{feldman_thermal_1993,
feldman_numerical_1999} Estimates based on experimental measurements 
have shown $k_{pr}$ as low as 
$~20\%$\cite{cahill_thermal_1994,feldman_numerical_1999} 
and as high as $~80\%$ $k_{vib}$.
\cite{liu_high_2009,yang_anomalously_2010}
While predictions for $k_{pr}$ for a-Si 
depend on the experimental sample preparations
(cite) 
and the assumed scaling of the low-frequency 
vibrational diffusivities 
(see Section \ref{S:Theory:Thermal}),(cite) 
all evidence supports that $k_{pr}$ is a significant fraction 
of $k_{vib}$.(cite) 

For a-SiO2, 
modeling based on experiments show that $k_{pr}$ is less than $10\%$ 
of $k_{vib}$,(cite) as is found in the present study.  
The propagating contribution $k_{pr}$  
can be identified for a-Si in this work and others, 
both experimentally
\cite{liu_high_2009,yang_anomalously_2010,minnich_thermal_2011,
regner_broadband_2013} 
and numerically
\cite{feldman_thermal_1993,feldman_numerical_1999,
mcgaughey_thermal_2004,he_heat_2011} 
using both scalings  
$n=2$\cite{feldman_thermal_1999,he_heat_2011} 
and 
$n=4$\cite{feldman_thermal_1993,cahill_thermal_1994,
liu_high_2009,yang_anomalously_2010}. 
for Eq. \eqref{EQ:Dw2}. In the next section we consider both of these 
scalings when predicting the thermal conductivity 
accumulation functions.

\subsection{\label{S:Accumulation}Accumulation Function}
%--------------------------------------------------------------------------

Recent broadband FDTR experiments by Regner et al. measured  
the apparent thermal conductivity change with 
the penetration depth $L_p$ of the experiments 
between $~40$ nm and $1 \mu$m.(cite)  
They argue that the apparent 
thermal conductivity variation with $L_p$ represents the accumulated 
thermal conductivity for propagating modes with MFP less than 
$L_p$. 
The thermal conductivity accumulation function,
\begin{equation}\label{EQ:matth}
k(\Lambda_{cut}) = \frac{1}{V}\int^{\Lambda_{cut}}_{0} 
kb D(\Lambda)DOS(\Lambda)    
+ 
\frac{1}{V}\sum_{\Lambda{\AF} < \Lambda_{cut}} kb v_{AF}\Lambda_{AF},
\end{equation}
is predicted using our models of bulk a-SiO2 and a-Si with 
the boundary scatter model 
Eq. \eqref{EQ:matth} and 
are shown in Fig.. 
The mode MFPs $\Lambda$ are found using Eqs. and . The 
non-propagating diffuson contribution $k_{AF}$ is considered 
a constant as discussed in Section \ref{S:Bulk}.  

The thermal conductivity accumulation function for a-SiO2 saturates 
at a MFP of about 10 nm, which is on the order of the finite size 
of our model (Section \ref{S:Sample}). 
This sharp accumulation at small MFPs is 
in good agreement with the prediction that $k_{AF}$ is the dominant 
contribution to $k_{vib}$ (Section \ref{S:Bulk}). 
This result is also in accord 
with the penetration depth-independent thermal 
conductivity measurements using broadband FDTR.
\cite{regner_broadband_2013} Only the quadratic scaling is 
considered for a-SiO2, which is discussed later in 
Section \ref{S:Accumulation}. 

For a-Si, the propagating contribution $k_{ph}$ is predicted 
using both scalings Eq. \eqref{EQ:Dw2} with $n=2$ and $n=4$. 
As discussed in Section \ref{S:Conductivity}, 
the $n=2$ scaling best describes the propagating 
contribution for our model of bulk a-Si. 
The thermal conductivity accumulation 
functions for both scalings $n=2,4$ are shown in Fig. 
using $t_f = 80 \mu$m with the boundary-scattering model 
Eq. \eqref{EQ:matth}. Also shown in Fig. are the broadband 
FDTR measurements of Regner, which show much sharper accumulations 
than either $n=2,4$ scalings, particularly for $t_f = 2 \mu$m 
(labeled Regner B in Fig. ). However, the plateau from the 
measurements of Regner for 
$\Lambda < 100$ nm is consistent with our 
prediction for $k_{AF}$. 
Our predicted $k_{vib}$ 
for varying $t_f$ using Eq. \eqref{EQ:matth} follows roughly the accumulation 
function, so the experimentally-measured thermal conductivities 
for varying $t_f$ are compared directly in Fig. .
The experimental 
measurements for different sample preparations are broadly 
categorized into 
(A) HWCVD(cite) and 
(B) sputtered(cite) 
techniques. Because of the large variation in 
experimental measurements, both scalings $n=2,4$ for 
$k_{vib}$ passes reasonably well 
through the measured values.(cite) It is worth nothing again 
that the results from these experiments have been interpreted 
using both $n=2,4$ scalings.(cite)

\subsection{\label{S:Discussion}Discussion}
%--------------------------------------------------------------------------

The transverse sound speed predicted for our model of 
a-SiO2 is about $85\%$ of that predicted by 
the other methods used in the present study and that 
measured by experiment.\cite{liu_high_2009}  
While using a smaller transverse sound speed 
leads to an underprediction of the 
mode diffusivity scalings (Eq. \eqref{EQ:Dtau},
Fig. \ref{FIG:diffusivities} ), it leads to an 
overprediction of the DOS (Eq. \eqref{EQ:DOS_debye}). 
Holding all other input parameters in Eq. \eqref{EQ:kvib} constant, 
a smaller sound speed leads to a larger $k_{pr}$ 
prediction because the DOS scales as 
$DOS(\omega)\propto 1/v^3_{s}$. In this sense we can regard 
the prediction for $k_{pr}$ from 
our model of a-SiO2 with reduced transverse sound speeds  
as an upper bound. 
The overestimate of the bulk thermal conductivity predicted 
for our model of a-SiO2 can be corrected  
Our model confirms that propagating modes do not contribute significantly 
to the thermal conductivity of a-SiO2.

For a-SiO2, previous experimental studies have estimated that the 
contribution $k_{pr}$ is negligible.
\cite{love_estimate_1990,baldi_thermal_2008}  
Using our model of a-SiO2, we also find the 
low-frequency propagating contribution to be negligible 
(Section \ref{S:Accumulation}). 
While experiments show there is a  
cross-over region for the low-frequency diffusivity scaling 
from $n=2$ to $n=4$ scaling,
\cite{masciovecchio_evidence_2006,baldi_emergence_2013} 
the propagating contribution 
was still negligible. 
The cross-over 
region from $n=2$ to $n=4$  
observed in experiments for  
a-SiO2 occurs in the frequency range $4.6 10^9$ to 
$1.52 10^{10}$ rads$/$s,\cite{masciovecchio_evidence_2006} 
and $3.04 10^11$ to 
$1.52 10^{12}$ rads$/$s
\cite{baldi_emergence_2013}. 
Our present model is not 
large enough to investigate the cross-over region for $n=2$ to 
$n=4$ scaling. The required model size will most likely 
keep the required frequency range inaccessible for some 
time to come. 

A transition between $n=2$ and $n=4$ scaling can be 
achieved using a phenomenological model where a cross-over frequency 
must be specified by experiment.
\cite{baldi_elastic_2011} While this cross-over can be identified 
experimentally for a-SiO2,\cite{masciovecchio_evidence_2006} 
experiments are limited for a-Si thin films.(cite) 
Our model for bulk a-Si seems best described by a propagating 
contribution $k_{pr}$ using Eq. \eqref{EQ:Dw2} with $n=2$ (see Fig. ). 
Using the boundary 
scattering model Eq. \eqref{matth} to  predict the thermal conductivity 
accumulation function in Fig. with $n=2$ and $n=4$ shows that 
the experimental measurements for a-Si thin films are still not 
well-understood. Our model can describe the accumulations predicted 
by broadband FDTR measurements by Regner only qualitatively in the 
short and long MFP limits. 
While the low-frequency scaling of the 
diffusivities has been investigated experimentally for a-SiO2, 
experimental measurements for a-Si are lacking. Measurements 
of the thermal conductivity of a-Si thin films with varying 
temperature suggest both 
$n=2$(cite) and 
$n=4$(cite) 
separately based on varying preparation techniques. 

While there is no clear consensus from various experiments, all 
predictions in this 
work demonstrate that  
the low-frequency modes in bulk a-Si follow a $n=2$ scaling 
of the low-frequency mode diffusivities, 
which has been observed in previous models of a-Si(cite) and 
a-SiO2.(cite)
Amorphous silicon, however, can be
prepared only in thin films,(cite) where voids and other 
inhomogeneities are unavoidable\cite{li_effect_2011} and can influence the 
vibrational structure at low frequencies.
\cite{feldman_tight-binding_2004,liu_high_2009} Our models 
are not large enough to investigate the relevant frequency range 
($< 1 10^{12}$ rads$/$s) where the scaling 
transition occurs,(cite)

\section{\label{S:Lifetimes}Summary}
%--------------------------------------------------------------------------

In this work we investigated the contributions of propagating ($k_{ph}$) 
and non-propagating ($k_{AF}$) modes to the total vibrational 
thermal conductivity $k_{vib}$ of two amorphous materials, 
a-SiO2 and a-Si, using the NMD method (Section \ref{S:Life}), 
GK method (Section \ref{S:Bulk}), 
and AF theory (Section \ref{S:Diffusivities}). 
Using the NMD method and the AF theory, 
we predict the total thermal conductivity $k_{vib}$ and its 
contributions from $k_{pr}$ and $k_{AF}$ using a bottom-up approach 
based on the mode-by-mode properties. Using the GK method and very-large 
models (including the largest simulated model of a-Si we are aware of, 
see Section \ref{S:Sample}), 
we predict $k_{vib}$ of bulk a-SiO2 and a-Si. For our model of bulk a-Si 
the thermal conductivity $k_{vib}$ has  
significant contribution from $k_{ph}$, where the low-frequency 
propagating modes are best described by a scaling of their 
diffusivities Eq. \eqref{EQ:Dw2} with $n=2$ (see Section \ref{S:Theory:Thermal}).  

For a-SiO2, the contribution from propagating modes $k_{ph}$ was shown to 
be negligible compared to $k_{vib}$ (Section \ref{S:Bulk}). 
This is confirmed by various 
experimental measurements,(cite) including the broadband FDTR study 
by Regner et al. which 
probed the vibrational MFPs of a-SiO2.(cite) Our thermal conductivity 
accumulation function for a-SiO2 is in good agreement with the 
broaband FDTR measurements of Regner if quantum statistical effects are 
taken into account for the prediction $k_{AF}$ 
(see Section \ref{S:Bulk}). 

The thermal conductivity accumulation predicted for our model of bulk 
a-Si with a simple boundary scattering model and the scaling 
Eq. \eqref{EQ:Dw2} with $n=2$ shows reasonable agreement 
with the experimentally measured thermal conductivities 
of varying film thicknesses and preparation techniques (Fig. ).(cite) 
However, a scaling $n=4$ with our model also gives 
a satisfactory agreement with experimental measurements (Fig. ).(cite) 
The large discrepancies between measured 
thermal conductivities of various a-Si thin films and 
the scalings $n=2,4$ with our model suggest that a comprehensive 
experimental study is necessary. Ideally, a-Si thin films  
prepared using different techniques and varying film thicknesses 
would be measured using the broadband techniques in the frequency-domain 
and/or time-domain to investigate the low-frequency behavior of 
these films.\cite{koh_frequency_2007,siemens_quasi-ballistic_2010,
minnich_thermal_2011,regner_broadband_2013}
It may be particularly helpful to perform the broadband techniques at 
low temperatures ($< 10$ K) where the propagating contribution 
$k_{pr}$ dominates $k_{vib}$ for both a-SiO2 and a-Si. 
A comprehensive experimental study could help answer long-held 
questions about the scaling of the low-frequency vibrational 
diffusivities in glasses.(cite)
